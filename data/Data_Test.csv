New Delhi: Gadgets have become an integral part of our lives with most of us relying on some form of factor to communicate, commute, work, be informed or entertained. Year 2019 will see some gadgets lifting the user experience to a whole new level. Here’s what we can expect to see:


Smartphones with foldable screens: Foldable phones are finally moving from the concept stage to commercial launches. They are made up of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels with higher plastic substrates, allowing them to be bent without damage.


US-based display maker Royole Corp’s foldable phone, FlexPai, has already arrived in select markets, while Samsung’s unnamed foldable phone is expected sometime next year. Samsung’s smartphone chief executive officer D.J. Koh has said they will make a million units of it. LG, too, is expected to display a foldable phone next year. Meanwhile Apple, Nokia, Lenovo and Huawei have also been working on foldable phones, reportedly.


eSIM: Very soon your smartphone won’t need a physical SIM card anymore. The eSIM technology, already used by Apple in its iPhones and Apple Watch, replaces the physical SIM with a virtually embedded chip on the motherboard. eSIMs support multiple mobile operators and can be programmed to switch services."

"It can be confusing to pick the right smartphone for yourself, so we have segregated the top smartphones under Rs 20,000 according to their strengths.

Gone are the days when you had to shell out big buck for buying smartphones with premium features. Technology has become more accessible recently and the biggest example of that lies in the sub-Rs 20,000 category—you get good performance, design and even software at a reasonable price.


It can be confusing to pick the right smartphone for you, however, given the amount of variety that lies in the segment. So we have segregated the top smartphones under ? 20,000 according to their strengths, so you can pick the one that suits you best.


This phone actually lies just north of the ? 20,000 price point. But if you have an HDFC debit or credit card, you can purchase the lowest spec variant with 6GB RAM and 64GB internal storage for as low as ? 19,999, making it the cheapest smartphone to run a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC. There’s not a lot to not like about this phone—it has the fastest processor Qualcomm has to offer, some thermal trickery to keep your smartphone cool during intense gaming sessions, a very good camera and some durable plastic that doesn’t shatter or pick up scratches.


It even gets a modded version of the MIUI with an app drawer that allows you colour code your applications."
"The mobile application is integrated with a dashboard to confirm and register the pre-registered cases, to enable online interface between the beneficiary and the panel lawyer through video conferencing and telephone facility.

Till January, it resulted in enabling legal advice to 49,192 beneficiaries that include 36,526 (Women), 7049 (SC) and 13970 (ST) in 11 states including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and all North-Eastern states and the State of Jammu and Kashmir, he said.

"The NCP leadership was under tremendous pressure to consider fielding third-generation Pawars from key constituencies in western Maharashtra. Parth Pawar was open about his keenness to contest from the Maval Lok Sabha constituency near Pune. Rohit Pawar, son of Sharad Pawar’s brother Rajendra Pawar, is also keen on entering the electoral arena and has set his eyes on the Karjat-Jamkhed assembly constituency in Ahmednagar constituency. The pressure increased after Sharad Pawar said he would contest from Madha while Sule would seek re-election from Baramati.


Last month, Sharad Pawar sought to end speculation by saying that no third-generation Pawar would contest Lok Sabha polls. However, NCP leaders and some legislators say that both Parth Pawar and Rohit Pawar were not ready to wait.


Before Pawar intervened, the Maval constituency saw posters of Parth Pawar coming up in several places. Known to be more ambitious of the two third-generation ticket aspirants, Parth had started touring the constituency some six months back, one NCP legislator said. “He is very keen to get into active politics.

In West Bengal, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is looking to win at least half the seats, says the party’s state president and Medinipur candidate Dilip Ghosh. Tackling corruption and implementing National Register of Citizens are on the party’s agenda if it wins, he said in an interview.


Restoration of democracy is the main agenda of this election. The one-point programme of the BJP is to protect democracy because there is no democracy in West Bengal. In the panchayat elections last year, people could not file nominations for over a third of the seats. Trinamool Congress members surrounded the office where nominations were to be filed for seven days. There was large-scale violence during panchayat elections. In 20,100 of 58,000 panchayat seats, nobody could file a nomination; over 42% of rural voters were unable to cast their votes. This is the situation in West Bengal. The second big issue is corruption and political violence. At least 42 BJP workers were killed and over 100 political killings have happened across the state. The police force is not allowed to investigate these cases. Yet, BJP won 7,000 seats in the panchayat election even after so much violence. (READ MORE)"

While the rupee pared some of 2018's losses early this year, it has remained under pressure. It lost about 1 percent against the dollar last month due to a significant surge in fuel prices - India's largest import - and a strengthening U.S. currency.


The Reserve Bank of India has also cut the main repo rate twice in the run-up to the election, putting it at 6.0 percent, 50 basis points lower than where it was at the start of the year.

That event kickstarted the nationwide movement against Indira Gandhi’s government, leading to the declaration of Emergency soon after.

The closure of traditional businesses and mills, the primary employers of the past century, also coincided with a deeper change in the fabric of Ahmedabad.


The economic changes caused fissures between Hindu and Muslim communities, which eventually led to riots in 1985, 1992 and again in 2002. The city that prides itself on its link to Gandhi is also one where his ideals tend to be forgotten.


“It is interesting that the city first witnessed riots between Hindus and Muslims in the 1980s, around the same time many lost formal employment and livelihood because of the closure of the textile mills,"" says Rutul Joshi, associate professor at the city-based CEPT University (formerly called the Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology)."

"Today, we think of Marvel as the monolithic studio that each year reliably releases two or three blockbusters based on its costume-clad comic-book superheroes


 It has built movies like “Captain Marvel” and “Black Panther” into money-minting franchises, and when its latest offering, “Avengers: Endgame,” is released April 26, it will conclude a narrative spanning some 22 films that started with “Iron Man” in 2008


 In the mid-2000s it was a smaller, inexperienced company that controlled the film rights for only a few of its lesser-known characters — other studios had already brought “X-Men,” “Spider-Man” and “Fantastic Four” to theaters — at a time when no one in Hollywood was yet contemplating the idea of an interconnected universe of superhero movies


That changed with the help of people like Kevin Feige, who had been an associate producer on “X-Men” before Marvel hired him in 2000; and Robert Downey Jr


, the veteran actor who was almost no one’s idea of a mass-market magnet when he emerged as a candidate to play Tony Stark, the eccentric billionaire hero of “Iron Man


”In interviews, Feige, now president of Marvel Studios, and Downey — a star of three “Iron Man”s, four “Avengers” and a “Spider-Man” — spoke about the origins of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the choices they made, and what it’s all meant as “Endgame” approaches


KEVIN FEIGE: In 2006, when we were making our first appearance as our own studio at Comic-Con, the articles written around that were basically: “Marvel’s going to try to make movies themselves now


 Iron Man became one of them when the rights reverted back to Marvel from [New Line Cinema]; it instantly went to the top of the list


 And internally, at Marvel corporate, “Hulk” — by far, the better-known property — seemed like the slam dunk and “Iron Man” seemed like the risk


Marvel started hiring cast and crew for “Iron Man” in 2006 — first, director Jon Favreau and then its star, Robert Downey Jr

But for people that already have it (crypto currencies), having tools to trade and exchange and securely store crypto is still super valuable. I’m still pretty optimistic that in the long run India will be one of the places where digital currencies could have a very powerful and significant impact in helping people with access to smartphones to be able to move money around as easily as sending a message. That being said, there are reasonable and understandable concerns and risks that should be addressed. In other markets, we’re seeing very strong pro-innovation regulatory environments that are allowing for very fast iteration on these capabilities. We’ve received strong regulatory guidance and clarity across Europe and the US. South Korea and Japan are also very forward on this stuff.


The original networks were not designed for high throughput. They were designed for settlement with a high degree of certainty. We wanted to make sure that transactions were completed with finality. On the other hand, when you swipe a credit card and buy something, you can claw back that transaction for 90 days. I think credit cards are really a terrible mechanism for banking, especially over the internet.


In terms of throughput, it’s not a lot of work to do to increase capacity on these (blockchain) transaction networks. Just two weeks ago, we (blockchain.com) announced the introduction of Stellar, which allows for a much higher volume of transactional volume on a per second basis than bitcoin does, for example. We also spent a lot of time looking at the “lightning network"". Basically, it is a hyper capacity capability that will far exceed Mastercard and Visa in terms of total capacity there. Those networks can do about 50,000 transactions per second while the lightning network is looking at numbers far in excess of that at near-zero cost."

“The members are first solicited publicly using these invite links and then the trusted ones (in this case, who would actually engage in sharing CSAM) are called on to join a more private group. Numbers used to create groups are often virtual numbers used by Indian users. There are several such tactics being used by group admins and members,"" said Nitish Chandra, a cybersecurity expert and Manager-Training and Policy Cyber Peace Foundation, in an email reply to Mint. The findings were first reported by The News Minute.


According to the Foundation’s report, many groups are created by people with Indian phone numbers with their group descriptions in Hindi. Many of these groups also lay emphasis on sharing of child pornography videos and no other links, while some require their members to share a specified number of videos every day or face dismissal from the group. Their activities are not limited to circulation of CSAM. Many even solicit physical contact with children with details like price, location and time."

"Further rupee gains maybe limited in the near term due to USD/INR support at 200-DMA, currently at 70.58, and an additional support at 69.230, the Jan. 7 low  (Reuters)


India’s rupee has snapped out of its recent doldrums, thanks to the easing in the military skirmishes with Pakistan and strong foreign flows into the nation’s shares. Analysts aren’t sure if the gains will sustain with elections due by May.


The currency has rebounded about 2% since early February, and is no longer the worst performer this year among Asia’s emerging market currencies -- a tag it held as recent as last week when tensions between India and Pakistan briefly reached the highest point since a 1971 war.


The flare up settled just as global funds warmed up to local shares again. They invested a net $2.4 billion last month, the most since November 2017. The data helped the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex jump more than a percent on Tuesday and the rupee rose to its highest close since Jan. 10."
"The brokerage firm points out that 7-Eleven Malaysia has been in operation for 30 years and enjoys a 30% gross margin, a 6% Ebitda (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin and ~40-50% return on capital employed. Future Retail’s Ebitda margin so far in FY19 stands at 5%, and it has a return on capital employed of about 20%.


Investors cheered the news, with the Future Retail stock rising 5.7% in the past two trading days on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India.


This marks the entry of 7-Eleven into India, regarded as one of the fastest-growing retail markets in the world. 7-Eleven is set to benefit from Future Retail’s vast experience of operating in Indian markets and understanding the local consumer. Indeed, some analysts see 7-Eleven’s choice of its India partner as a vote of confidence in Future Retail. The first 7-Eleven convenience store is expected to open this year."

Widespread anger over violence during panchayat polls has turned 2019 Lok Sabha elections into a referendum on TMC's rule


The BJP’s strategy of whipping up Hindu religious pride in West Bengal, where 27% people are Muslims, seems to be paying off


Purulia/Bongaon/Kolkata: ""I am not a magician, I have done so much for you…even if I sell my blood, it will not get enough money (for your needs),"" a visibly emotional Mamata Banerjee told the crowd at an election rally in West Bengal on Tuesday. At every public meeting—84 have been planned so far, two for each parliamentary constituency in the state—the chief minister has been presenting a report card of her eight years at the helm in Bengal, and ending her speeches with an earthy appeal on the importance of maintaining communal harmony. Didi, as she is fondly referred to, typically ends her speech by reciting parts of Chandi shloka, an ode to goddess Durga—Bengal’s most worshipped deity.


After a visit to the Bengal hinterland, it becomes clear why the chief of Trinamool Congress (TMC) needs to invoke the gods. Mamata is fighting a furious battle to protect her turf from a resurgent Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).


The unpaved road which connects Bisriya village to the outside world is as rugged as it gets. On a hot summer afternoon in April, the village in West Bengal’s Purulia district, bordering Jharkhand, wore a deserted look. Few were lazing under the shade of a giant Kusum tree.

Most schemes, be it old-age pension for farmers or the state government’s housing scheme for the poor, have eluded him. “At every step you need to bribe local party leaders... in the 100-days work programme (the centre’s employment guarantee scheme) the work is being done by JCB machines.

I gave the Realme 2 Pro a lot of flak for its UI (ColorOS 5.2), but Realme (read Oppo) has rolled out some upgrades to get rid of the previous annoyances like app notifications and bloatware. The phone runs Android Oreo out of the box and there are no promises from Realme about a Pie upgrade, but since Oppo was a Android 9 developer partner, we can expect it to come by the January.


Coming back to the UI, there is still no app drawer, but the UI now allows you to swipe and dismiss notifications. The bloatware can also be uninstalled, bar a few apps like ORoaming.


Some apps do come in the way of the notch, but you can disable the notch on an app-by-app basis. The music app also likes to autoplay a “Rakshabandhan"" compilation whenever you pair a Bluetooth audio device, which can be mildly unnerving.


You can fix the lack of an app drawer with a launcher like Nova, but there isn’t really much of a fix for the drop-down notification bar.


The camera of Realme U1 is a mixed bag. It is a selfie-focused smartphone, so let’s dig into that first, even though I’m not much of a selfie person.


The front camera consists of a 25MP Sony IMX576 sensor paired with Helio P70’s image processing platform.


The AI capabilities allow 296 facial identification points (an overkill, but doesn’t hurt) and better noise and colour recovery. To add cherry on top of that selfie cake, it can correct backlight, just in case you click in front a bright light."
"The only thing we loathe about the phone is its app optimisation, which might get better as it receives the Pie upgrade.


This smartphone has “Play"" in its name, which definitely means it means business, right? Yes. It has the best chipset Huawei has to offer, the HiSilicon 970, which walks abreast with Snapdragon 845 standards. Although it doesn’t have any tricks to keep it cool, it can run PUBG on its best settings without any frame drops or heating tantrums. It also has a fairly premium design and very decent AI-powered cameras.


The only thing we dislike about this phone is its UI, which lacks an app drawer and has childish icons.


This phone is an absolute steal for the kind of display, software and, most importantly, the camera it has to offer— all at just a rupee below ? 20,000. The rear of the phone sports a 12MP+5MP ZEISS-enhanced package. At the front, it comes with an 8MP camera with f/2.0 aperture. The phone was launched yesterday and it will go on sale on 7 December, so you might have to wait a bit if you wanted to buy this phone right away.


Other things to like about the smartphone are the 5.84-inch HDR display, ability to notch it up to Android Pie, understated design and stock Android experience, thanks to the Android One platform it runs (if you’re into that).


The Mi A2 received quite a bit of flak for skipping crucial features like the Micro USB port and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It also received a significant bump in its price. But that doesn’t make the Mi A2 a slacker by any means. It is powered by the best mid-range processor Qualcomm had to offer at the time, the Snapdragon 660 and runs stock Android. It also has one of the best cameras in the segment—12MP + 20MP dual rear camera module and 20MP front-facing camera, both of which are AI-enabled.


It carries the same aluminium unimetal arch design of the Mi A1, which may look a bit dated to a few."

Asked if the pilot will be run in Congress-ruled states, Gandhi said experts will decide on that. ""This is for the experts to decide. In the 10 years of the Congress-UPA govt, we took 14 crore people out of poverty net. Our goal now is to finish the job,"" he said.


Gandhi added that 20-22% families are living in poverty even today. Many of them have been pushed into this cycle by the prime minister's demonetisation scheme and 'Gabbar Singh Tax', he noted.

"This year’s TV is called the LG Signature TV OLED R and its screen disappears into the base when not in use. While that is impressive technology indeed, we knew it was coming for years now.


Like LG’s rollable OLED, Samsung’s new micro-LED TV doesn’t really tickle our fancy either. That’s because the original version of this was announced at CES 2018. Known as “The Wall"", the micro-LED TV was too big for any household at the time. So, Samsung has now made it smaller, enough to fill an average household. The new micro-LED TV comes in 75-inch screen size, which is more suited to mainstream use. What this really means is that micro-LED technology (which has been around for a few years) is finally ready for mainstream use, though it’s nowhere close to being affordable just yet.


Micro-LED is a technology similar to Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED), though unlike OLEDs, it doesn’t use organic compounds to create light. Micro-LED offers the same picture quality as OLEDs, but is said to be brighter and overcomes OLED’s one big weakness— burn in (a display’s tendency to retain images, thereby forming discolouration in certain areas and affecting the overall viewing experience)."

The operational, financial and reputational costs of breaches are rising as well. In some cases, CEOs and board members have been forced to resign. Many boards, however, are just waking up to this risk. The following questions can provide a framework for corporate directors as they fulfil their fiduciary responsibilities.


It is critical to risk-rank data assets to identify which ones can make or break an organization. For instance, the clinical trials data of a pharmaceutical company, call data records of a telecom enterprise and patient care records of a hospital would fall in the high-risk category. How can such crown jewels be protected? The mainstream approach is to identify potential threat-actors and vulnerabilities, implement controls, and finally, thwart attacks by leveraging analytics-enabled threat-monitoring tools. Another approach—suggested by leading cybersecurity experts—is to isolate critical assets from the internet, minimize their digital footprint, and monitor them by using analogue devices and trusted human beings.

In reality, it hosts diverse content including a fair share of political speech,"" said Kailas Karthikeyan, a New Delhi-based technology analyst who has tracked TikTok for nine months.


TikTok's video-only interface makes it less elaborate and easier to use compared to platforms such as Facebook or Twitter, making it a bigger attraction in rural India, he added.


While Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Congress party have not officially joined TikTok, videos tagged #narendramodi have received more than 30 million views and those about Congress chief Rahul Gandhi (#rahulgandhi) have got nearly 13 million hits. Total views for political videos is far higher.


Amit Malviya, the BJP's chief of information technology, said the party was tracking TikTok conversations and it was ""a brilliant medium for creative expression"". The party, however, has no plans as of now to officially join the platform, he said.


A Congress source said the party was exploring joining TikTok and assessing how it could be used to better reach out to people in rural areas in the run-up to the election.


Not all political videos on TikTok seek votes. Some videos show people waving the Congress flag on Indian streets. Another clip shows Modi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on a stage, with a Hindi-language rustic voiceover of her saying she will marry the Indian leader."

Sumalatha has the backing of disgruntled Congress and JD(S) supporters as well as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), that is looking for an entry into the Vokkaliga heartland, where it has limited presence.


The seat is also testing the coalition’s resolve to remain together as a defeat for Nikhil in all probability could see the JD(S) pull out of the alliance and government.

It is unclear how much revenue the pirate distributors are siphoning away from Apple and legitimate app makers  


SAN FRANCISCO: Software pirates have hijacked technology designed by Apple Inc to distribute hacked versions of Spotify, Angry Birds, Pokemon Go, Minecraft and other popular apps on iPhones, Reuters has found.


Illicit software distributors such as TutuApp, Panda Helper, AppValley and TweakBox have found ways to use digital certificates to get access to a program Apple introduced to let corporations distribute business apps to their employees without going through Apple's tightly controlled App Store.


Using so-called enterprise developer certificates, these pirate operations are providing modified versions of popular apps to consumers, enabling them to stream music without ads and to circumvent fees and rules in games, depriving Apple and legitimate app makers of revenue.


By doing so, the pirate app distributors are violating the rules of Apple's developer programs, which only allow apps to be distributed to the general public through the App Store. Downloading modified versions violates the terms of service of almost all major apps."

For instance, apps such as GOQii that focus primarily on preventive healthcare have doctors and coaches on board who advise people on how to stay healthy. GOQii has tied its services with its fitness bands. This has helped them win a loyal user base. “What happens in the healthcare category, is that most apps have millions of downloads but the number of active users is much lower.

Mumbai: Sci-fi movies typically project robots, mostly humanoids, in a scary light--ones that attempt to overpower the human race.

Edited excerpts:


We can do fairly advanced things in terms of decision making and inference—as in taking data, using some clever machine learning (ML) algorithms and doing inference on data to extract information that is not obviously visible to the human eye. But when it goes from that to changing the state of the world—means using robots to move things around, navigate in a cluttered environment and work with noisy sensors—we’re still quite far away from a robustness perspective. We do a lot of things as proof of concepts in laboratories, but moving that from labs to complicated environments is still a big challenge."

Jaitley also asked how the Congress would raise resources for its minimum income guarantee scheme, NYAY. “The promises of the Congress cannot be believed. Former Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi had indulged in fiscal mismanagement and the country had faced a debt trap. India was on the verge of insolvency when Mammohan Singh became Prime Minister. The Congress now says NYAY will be funded by the Union government and state governments,"" he said."

"That’s one of the reasons asset managers such as DHFL Pramerica Asset Managers Pvt. and HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. favor the front-end of the yield curve. At the same time, escalating concern about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plan to sell almost $100 billion of debt is damping the appeal of longer maturities.


“The RBI rate cut and expectations of a further reduction will support the short end,"" said Puneet Pal, deputy head of fixed income at DHFL Pramerica Asset Managers Pvt. in Mumbai, who favors debt due in four years or less. Meanwhile, the “demand-supply dynamics are likely to deteriorate going ahead, negating a big move down in long-term yields.""


The odds for more rate cuts is rising as inflation slows, with Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das pointing to the CPI to justify a surprise 25 basis-point reduction in the policy rate last week. Consumer-price growth fell to 2.05 percent in January, well below the RBI’s medium-term target of 4 percent."
"The payment from Qualcomm to Apple - part of a 2011 deal between Apple and Qualcomm - was meant to ease the technical costs of swapping out the iPhone’s then-current Infineon chip with Qualcomm’s, CEO Steve Mollenkopf testified at a trial with the US Federal Trade Commission.


Under the 2011 deal, Qualcomm was named Apple’s sole supplier of modem chips, which help mobile phones connect to wireless data networks, in exchange for which Qualcomm agreed to give Apple a rebate - the exact nature of which has not been disclosed. Apple could choose another supplier but it would lose the rebate, effectively increasing the cost of its chips.


Antitrust regulators have argued the deal with Apple was part of a pattern of anticompetitive conduct by Qualcomm to preserve its dominance in modem chips and exclude players like Intel."

Uttar Pradesh is crucial for political parties as it sends 80 members to the Lok Sabha. The ruling BJP-led coalition won 73 seats in the state in the 2014 general elections, and again stamped its political dominance in the 2017 assembly elections by winning a three-fourth majority. This will, however, be the first time that BJP will face the combined force of three regional heavyweights in statewide elections. BJP, however, lost bypolls in Uttar Pradesh’s Gorakhpur and Phulpur, two of its bastions, in 2018 to the regional alliance.


The western region of the state goes to the polls on 11 April in the first phase of general elections. In the 2014 Lok Sabha and 2017 assembly polls, BJP had won most of the seats from the region. The dominance of BJP in the state prompted the three parties to contest the elections jointly.


The three leaders said that though the BJP had promised jobs for the youth, better prices to farmers and safety for women, it failed to deliver on them. Despite that, both BJP and Congress were again trying to misguide the poor by promising to end poverty."

"All four smartphones cater to a different target audience, even though three of them are from the same parent company


mint-india-wire Realme U1Redmi Note 6 Prorealme U1 comparisonOppo A7Vivo Y95Realme mobilesOppoVivoXiaomiRedmiAmazonFlipkart


The Realme U1 was launched on Wednesday in India. While the phone boasts of MediaTek’s flagship Helio P70 processor, it is also priced in the same category as the Redmi Note 6 Pro. However, Vivo and Oppo also launched their newest sub ? 15,000 smartphones earlier this week. This makes up for an exciting (and inevitable) comparison. Here’s how the four smartphones stand against each other.


All phones except the Note 6 Pro have glossy rear panels. The Redmi Note 6 Pro features an all-Aluminium body. The main difference between the glossy backs of the Realme U1, Oppo A7 and Vivo Y95 lies in colour schemes and the optical trickery—the material is the same i.e. polycarbonate resin.


Realme U1 goes for a mirror finish, while the Oppo A7 goes for vertical grooves that reflect light in different directions. The Vivo Y95 has a dual-tone gradient with metallic finish that give a starry appearance. Polycarbonate is more durable than glass as plastic is more shatter resistant. The Redmi Note 6 Pro looks a bit conservative in its design language, as the all-Aluminium look is starting to look dated these days."

"Satyajit Ray was a legendary filmmaker who not just influenced directors and actors in India, but artistes across the world


 On Ray’s 98th birth anniversary, Sahapedia looks at the Bengali filmmaker’s relationship with two influential women —Indira Gandhi and Marie Seton—who recognised and supported his genius


As India sought to rebuild itself post Independence, its filmmakers found patronage from a rather unusual and enthusiastic quarter—film connoisseurs and cinephiles such as Jawahar Lal Nehru and Indira Gandhi—who helped them reach the global arena


 The iconic Bengali filmmaker Satyajit Ray, who placed India on the global film map firmly with his landmark debut movie Pather Panchali (1955), was a product of such patronage


 Ray’s early supporters were two influential women—Indira Gandhi, the first female prime minister of India, and Marie Seton, a family friend of the Nehrus and a British film consultant, who had been invited to India in the 1950s to assist the government with the making and promotion of films after penning a biography of the Russian director Sergei Eisenstein


 In 1952, she brought one of her family friends, Indo-French director Jahangir Bhownagary to India to launch the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) under the Films Division


Indira Gandhi was excited about the release of Satyajit Ray’s Pather Panchali in 1955 and its compassionate portrayal of countryside poverty in India"

So we are going to have to deal with that.""


Contrary to futuristic fears of “super-intelligent"" robots taking control, the real dangers of our tech era have crept in more prosaically — often in the form of tech innovations we welcomed for making life more convenient .


Part of experts’ concern about the leap into connecting every home device to the internet and letting computers do our work is that the technology is still buggy and influenced by human errors and prejudices. Uber and Tesla were investigated for fatal self-driving car crashes in March, IBM came under scrutiny for working with New York City police to build a facial recognition system that can detect ethnicity, and Amazon took heat for supplying its own flawed facial recognition service to law enforcement agencies.


In some cases, opposition to the tech industry’s rush to apply its newest innovations to questionable commercial uses has come from its own employees. Google workers helped scuttle the company’s Pentagon drone contract, and workers at Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce sought to cancel their companies’ contracts to supply tech services to immigration authorities.


“It became obvious to a lot of people that the rhetoric of doing good and benefiting society and ‘Don’t be evil’ was not what these companies were actually living up to,"" said Whittaker, who is also a research scientist at Google who founded its Open Research group.


At the same time, even some titans of technology have been sounding alarms. Prominent engineers and designers have increasingly spoken out about shielding children from the habit-forming tech products they helped create.


And then there’s Microsoft President Brad Smith, who in December called for regulating facial recognition technology so that the “year 2024 doesn’t look like a page"" from George Orwell’s “1984."""

"The impact will vary. Rising oil prices will hurt household income and spending and it could accelerate inflation. As the world’s biggest importer of oil, China is vulnerable, and many countries in Europe also rely on imported energy. Seasonal effects will also impact. With the Northern Hemisphere summer approaching, consumers can switch energy sources and scale back usage. A slowing world economy will also hurt demand and by extension keep a lid on prices.


For a sustained hit to growth, economists say oil would need to hold above $100. It also depends on dollar strength or weakness, given crude is priced in greenbacks. Analysis by Oxford Economics found that Brent at $100 per barrel by the end of 2019 means the level of global gross domestic product would be 0.6 percent lower than currently projected by end-2020, with inflation on average 0.7 percentage points higher.


“We see increased risks of significantly higher oil prices,"" Oxford economists John Payne and Gabriel Sterne wrote in a note. “In the short-run, it is likely the supply impact will be offset by higher production elsewhere, but the market is tightening and all it would take is one more shock to supply and oil could reach $100.""


An upending of global oil trade around the Iran-Trump spat could continue to have a sizable impact on financial markets, as the affected supply is as much as 800,000 barrels a day. Uncertainties around availability have already whipsawed oil markets. And the political sensitivities of these developments have other markets bracing for volatility."

"Lawmakers are still hashing out how to define small excerpts of stories and whether individual words should be covered by the copyright rules, according to an EU official who asked not to be identified. The rules would also require Google and Facebook to actively prevent music, videos and other copyrighted content from appearing on their platforms if rights holders didn't grant them a license.


Despite the delay, an agreement is possible in the next few months, two EU officials said. If there's no accord by the spring, when European Parliament elections are held, the process would be delayed until later this year.


As with many divisive issues in European regulation, the problem is the small print. When the commission first unveiled draft rules, it proposed letting publishers waive their rights to demand payment from news-aggregation services. The European Parliament introduced a provision last year that raises concerns among some small publishers that they wont be able to let Google distribute their content online free of charge.


The impact of a Google News withdrawal on publishers who rely on the search giant for traffic to their sites is unclear. Google shut its news service in Spain in 2014 after the country passed a law requiring Spanish publications to charge aggregators for displaying excerpts of stories. Publishers must claim compensation for the reuse of fragments of text whether they want to or not.


The Spanish law led to small publishers losing about 13% of their web traffic, according to a 2017 study released by the Spanish Association of Publishers of Periodical Publications. That translates to a cost of at least 9 million euros ($10.2 million), the study estimated."

"Voice Recognition: The speech recognition market is expected to grow from $1.1 billion in 2017 to $6.9 billion by 2025. With support for voice assistants being built into all kinds of gadgets, users will eventually not have to rely on physical remote controls-


According to a MarketsandMarkets report, the eSIM market is estimated to grow from $253.8 million in 2018 to $978.3 million in 2023. In India, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd have already started providing eSIM services.


A market report by Beecham Research claims that an industry-wide adoption and deployment of the eSIM will lead to 34% higher market growth in the mobile industry by 2020.


Voice as an interface: The advancements in machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) have made conversing with voice assistants less frustrating. They are slowly getting better at understanding the context and intent of people.

A voice command from anywhere will get things done in a jiffy. Research firm Tractica has predicted that the voice and speech recognition market is expected to grow from $1.1 billion in 2017 to $6.9 billion by 2025.

"Indian fans woke up Monday morning to witness ‘The Long Night’ in Game of Thrones, which promised a gory battle at Winterfell between the armies of the living and dead, and found the third episode of the hit HBO series’ final season to be darker than what Melisandre predicted in her visions


The latest chapter was billed to have the most action and bloodshed after two consecutive slogging, build-up episodes, now that the White Walkers and wights were a stone’s throw away from the gates of the northern stronghold and it was every bit that


So, imagine the plight of fans unable to figure out ‘who died how?’ and ‘who killed whom?’ as the ‘Great War’ was being fought in abysmally dim lighting


Majority of the battle takes place at night, so the low light makes sense, but fans complained on social media that even with raging fires all around the castle, they struggled to see the action clearly"
"“The Samsonite campaign is a smart example of bringing a social message and product together but there are multiple brand categories that will not work like that,"" said Naresh Gupta, strategy head and managing partner at advertising agency Bang In The Middle.


A clutch of brands such as DB Corp. Ltd-owned radio brand 94.3 My FM, food delivery startup Swiggy, movie ticket booking platform BookMyShow, and KFC India are running various campaigns to remind young voters to exercise their voting rights.


“Brands need to be part of the cultural narrative and they need to have a point of view on what’s happening in the country. Creating such campaigns makes a brand sensitive, responsible, and relevant in people’s lives,"" said Dheeraj Sinha, the India managing director and chief strategy officer of Leo Burnett, South Asia."
"Artificial intelligence-driven engines are learning more about consumer behaviour—the more the AI engine knows about you, the better recommendation it will be able to provide along with customized emotional or economic benefits from the providers. Mobility startup Mobacar, for instance, uses machine learning to predict the mode of transport and type of vehicle a traveller may want and pushes only relevant offers, while travel assistant Mezi uses natural language processing to provide a personalized experience to business travellers who usually are short of time.


Biometrics can help simplify the journey and may replace the identity documents, maybe even passports, through fingerprint, facial or iris recognition at customs, hotels and airline check-ins.


Robotics is being used in automating monotonous tasks. Customer service robots already exist at Munich, Bologna and Geneva airports. Social robot and digital concierge ‘FRAnny’, deployed at Frankfurt Airport, answers questions about the gate for airline departures, can direct passengers to specific restaurants and help them access the airport’s free Wi-Fi. In Sasebo, Japan, a hotel is run almost entirely by robots enabling check-in at reception and luggage transfer to rooms.


Blockchain is also seen as a future disruptor of the entire travel value chain through increased disintermediation and democratization. It has the potential to remove intermediaries and balance the bargaining power in the hands of online travel agencies (OTAs), and inventory owners. For instance, Winding Tree is a decentralized travel distribution platform for inventory tracking and Travala is a travel booking marketplace that ledgerizes and decentralizes the hotel industry, allowing users to add rooms backed by smart contracts.


These new age technologies will also have implications related to customer data, usage, storage and accessibility and are bound to give rise to data and privacy regulations.


While the customer is evolving and being pampered by the choices provided by these new age intermediaries between customer and hotel, the rise of other inventory providers like online travel aggregators, metasearch agencies and digital tour guides will also ensure that the business model on the supply side shifts. Today hotels and other inventory owners have less bargaining power at the hands of large online travel agencies (OTAs) but are coping as the cost of customer acquisition has reduced. But they are constantly grappling with the question of how much commission they should give away to the online travel aggregators."

"The chipmaker brought separate patent suits against Apple in Germany and China, winning bans on the sale of some models of the iPhone. Photo: Reuters


Qualcomm argues the US simply has its facts wrong and has failed to demonstrate any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour by the chipmaker against its rivals


Two years after the US Federal Trade Commission sued Qualcomm Inc., unleashing a series of existential challenges to the company’s business model, the chipmaker is about to get its chance to square the record.


Lawyers for the regulatory agency and the company are set to begin presenting arguments on January 4 in a 10-day jury trial over claims that Qualcomm is abusing its strength in the market for smartphone components to force Apple Inc. and others to pay inflated license fees.


While the two sides have said they’re in settlement negotiations, US District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, refused to delay proceedings and narrowed the scope of Qualcomm’s arguments in pre-trial rulings.


The case challenges San Diego-based Qualcomm’s business model, casting a shadow over one of the fundamental reasons it’s been so successful in the smartphone era. Losing to the FTC would threaten billions of dollars the company makes in licensing fees, which have been used to develop better chips and invent technology. Any cut to Qualcomm’s ability to pay for industry-leading research and design jeopardizes its future competitiveness as well as its current profits."

"At Wipro, the posts being examined include not only public posts but also those that are shared privately to a limited set of a user's friends. (Reuters)


Hyderabad: Over the past year, a team of as many as 260 contract workers in Hyderabad, India has ploughed through millions of Facebook Inc photos, status updates and other content posted since 2014.


These include the subject of the post - is it food, for example, or a selfie or an animal? What is the occasion - an everyday activity or major life event? And what is the author's intention - to plan an event, to inspire, to make a joke?


The work is aimed at understanding how the types of things users post on its services are changing, Facebook said. That can help the company develop new features, potentially increasing usage and ad revenue.


Details of the effort were provided by multiple employees at outsourcing firm Wipro Ltd over several months. The workers spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation by the Indian firm. Facebook later confirmed many details of the project. Wipro declined to comment and referred all questions to Facebook.


The Wipro work is among about 200 content labeling projects that Facebook has at any time, employing thousands of people globally, company officials told Reuters.


Many projects are aimed at ""training"" the software that determines what appears in users' news feeds and powers the artificial intelligence underlying many other features.


""It's a core part of what you need,"" said Nipun Mathur, the director of product management for AI at Facebook. ""I don't see the need going away.""


The content labeling program could raise new privacy issues for Facebook, according to legal experts consulted by Reuters. The company is facing regulatory investigations worldwide over an unrelated set of alleged privacy abuses involving the sharing of user data with business partners."

 Doesn’t this prove yet again that your big Bollywood heroes are truly zeroes!Overrated actors and human beings who have created a clout by clever PR machinery and careful manipulation of public sentiments


 Old stuffy morons who can’t tell the difference between what’s right and wrong and what is the need of the hour! So would it be so difficult to just edit out Alok Nath’s portions in the film and hire someone else and reshoot those bits even before the film promotions started? Nobody even knew before the posters and trailers that Alok Nath is in the film so if Ajay Devgn and the makers wanted they could have just quietly replaced him and re-shot his portions (which is barely 10-15 days for character actors in Bollywood) and given Vinta Nanda the respect she deserves as well as several other women who were troubled by this guy


 But no! They had to keep the alleged rapist in their film and rub it on not only Vinta’s but on all our faces as a show of solidarity with all rapists, molesters and harassers of Bollywood and an even greater show of arrogance and defiance against all things morally and conscientiously right

Will Muslims, Jains and Christians be mob lynched or thrown in the ocean? The BJP is fulfilling Pakistan’s agenda because even Pakistan wants to divide our country,"" he added."
"Other reviewers however reported no major issues with the gadgets Samsung provided.

Samsung may need to consider postponing the rollout of the Galaxy Fold because it risks a public relations “fiasco"" if the problems are widespread, Anthea Lai and Anand Srinivasan, analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a report.


“Delaying the Galaxy Fold’s expected April 26 launch date -- while not certain to occur -- could save the brand’s reputation from a repeat of the Note 7 debacle,"" they wrote. “Postponing the rollout would also have minimal impact to earnings, as only about 1 million units are expected to ship this year."""

"However, many users also approach third-party repair shops in electronic hubs like Delhi’s Nehru Place and Lamington Road in Mumbai. The reason: these shops charge a lot less and have more affordable replacement options for customers. For instance, the cost of getting the display replaced on the Galaxy Note 9 is ?13,840 (according to Samsung’s support webpage) with service charges on top, while in third-party shops one can get a copy at less than half the price.


“Third-party repair shops have both original parts as well as copy. The original parts cost ?2,000 to ?3,000 less than what authorized service centres charge. That is because they provide warranty for their replacements and third party shops don’t. The copy, which is sourced from China, costs many times less,"" explains Kailash Babu from Ankit Communication, a smartphone repair shop in Nehru Place. Besides, third-party stores try to repair the faulty parts rather than replacing whole components, thus saving consumers some money.


However, these attempts can often result in a harrowing experience. The phone may not offer the same level of experience and in some cases may stop working as well. Moreover, user data could be stolen and misused. For instance, in December 2018, several iPhone 8 users who had their handsets repaired by a third-party store found the display was not working after updating to iOS 11.3. According to researchers from Israel’s Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, third-party repair shops can record keyboard input and even exploit the operating system (OS) kernel on the handset by embedding a malicious chip in the third-party replacement screen."
"However, the BJP’s growth in the state over the last few years is quite visible, more so after the 2017 panchayat polls, when the party’s performance, aided by consistent ground work done by two Odia central ministers—petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan and tribal affairs minister Jual Oram—got national attention.

In this election, an alliance between the Samajwadi Party (SP) led by Akhilesh Yadav and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) led by Mayawati is trying to re-establish their roots and counter the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) narrative which is banking on the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and government schemes including Swachh Bharat Mission and Ujjwala.


Bundelkhand accounts for four Lok Sabha constituencies – Jhansi, Hamirpur, Jalaun and Banda. Other than Banda, the remaining three constituencies go to polls in the fourth phase on Monday. Of the 13 seats going to polls in Uttar Pradesh on Monday, BJP won 11 in 2014, including Union minister Uma Bharti from Jhansi, who has decided not to contest this time. Voters across the constituencies of Jhansi, Jalaun and Hamirpur feel that while there has been an improvement in law and order, the government has not been able to fulfil promises made to farmers and to increase jobs.


The area is of key importance to the BJP as it had won all four seats from here in 2014. Keeping its momentum going in the assembly elections, the BJP won all the 19 assembly segments across the four Lok Sabha constituencies in Bundelkhand. The party has been reaching out to other backward classes (OBCs) to gain ground.

The annual budgets will indicate the step up in each year in order to achieve the target in 2023-24, it said.


Challenging BJP’s AB-PMJAY, the Congress said, “We are of the firm belief that the insurance-based model cannot be the preferred model to provide universal healthcare in our country. Congress promises to vigorously promote and implement the free public hospitals-model to provide universal healthcare.

"A generation of our best engineers are spending their productive output on building behavioural nudges that manipulate users to stay on their platforms. Moving to a model where users pay for what they use could help us focus our efforts on ideas that meaningfully improve society.


But the innovation deficit could be more systemic. The economist Robert Gordon, a vocal proponent of this view, has argued that the golden age of technological innovation is behind us. To support his thesis, Gordon points out that before 1750s, there was virtually no economic growth. Inventions like the steam engine, railroads and telephone drove economic growth over the past 250 years. This growth spurt was an anomaly and there isn’t any reason to blindly believe we’ll continue to find new ways to grow.


His analyses suggests that most of the technology changes that improved our quality of life had taken place by the first half of the twentieth century. These include the internal combustion engine, electricity, air travel, indoor plumbing and kitchen appliances. We have just been incrementally improving them ever since.


The Boeing 707 was introduced in 1958. Since then, air travel hasn’t gotten that much faster. The kitchen in an average Western home largely resembles the kitchen from 1950s, albeit with more energy efficient appliances. Using productivity data for the past few decades, Gordon concludes that the major breakthroughs of recent times—personal computing and the internet—did improve our lives by automating tedious manual tasks. But the gains aren’t nearly as dramatic.


In particular, since the 2000s, most of the technological innovation has centered on entertainment and communication devices that are smaller and smarter. While our lives are certainly a lot richer, improving consumer utility isn’t on the same scale as inventing electricity. Finally, the growth of developing economies like India and China isn’t due to new innovation; these countries are merely catching-up and adopting technologies that have already been invented.


The “end of innovation"" thesis is appealing but it doesn’t explain why markers for innovation show an upward trend. The number of patents filed have continued to rise in the past few decades and adoption time for newer technologies has gotten shorter.


Instead of no more ideas, perhaps ideas are just getting harder to find. As another economist, Tyler Cowen suggests, in the past few centuries, we have plucked all the low hanging fruit. Innovation from here on out will get harder.


There is good evidence to support this view. Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University, and his colleagues studied research productivity across a variety of sectors. Their findings suggest that the cost of finding new ideas has increased, both financially and in the number of researchers needed. In aggregate, they compute that research productivity falls in half every 13 years. To maintain a constant growth in per capita GDP, the US must double the amount of research effort every 13 years.


Moore’s law highlights this tension well. A central tenet of the computer industry for the past fifty years, the law states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every year while the costs are halved. Despite predictions of its impending end, the trend has continued to hold— making computers faster and cheaper. But it comes at a cost. The number of researchers required to double chip density today is more than 18 times larger than the number required in the early 1970s."

"At the heart of Apple's shocking FaceTime bug, which allowed just about anyone to turn an iPhone into a live microphone, stands a 14-year-old boy who stumbled upon the eavesdropping flaw more than a week before Apple took action.


""The thing that surprised me the most was that this glitch happened in the first place,"" said Grant Thompson, a high school freshman in Tucson, Arizona. ""I'm only 14 and I found it by accident, instead of the people at Apple that get paid to find glitches.""


Not only that, but Grant and his mom said they spent a week unsuccessfully trying to get Apple to do something about the bug in its FaceTime group-chatting feature. The bug allowed callers to activate another person's microphone remotely even before the person has accepted or rejected the call.


""It took nine days for us to get a response,"" he said. ""My mom contacted them almost every single day through email, calling, faxing."" Of the fax, he jokes, ""I'm not even sure what that is. It's probably older than I am.""

Age has taken a toll this time and travelling by car becomes an ordeal for long distance but otherwise the election does not seem that difficult.

"Vadakkan was one of those old Congress leaders in Kerala who acted as a bridge between the local unit and the Delhi leadership. Many of the leaders first approached him to present their matters before the leadership in Delhi, said a Congress leader, requesting not to be named.


The Congress was not worried about the electoral impact, he said. For the Congress, Vadakkan does not have any base in Kerala, even at his native place, Thrissur, where his strongest contacts in Catholic church holds a significant sway. In fact, the buzz is that the Congress' denial of Thrissur seat in at least three polls, including this time, caused Vadakkan to quit.

"I think AI is going to change every job and will take away jobs too. But that need not be a bad thing. If AI is creating goods at a lower cost by automating things, we should rejoice. Arthur C. Clarke, science fiction author, wrote in 2001 that the goal of technology should be full unemployment and not full employment, so we all have time to be more creative. Humans historically believe that we have to work to be valuable.


That no longer has to be the case. Society can distribute the abundance that AI and robotics can make, allowing us to transition from a society-based on work, to a society based on creativity and exploration.


There are many people and companies that are trying to create open source AI. On the whole if we can share the ideas, it would allow more people to innovate instead of coming inside closed communities to take advantage of them. The strength of these algorithms is not just in the software but in the huge amounts of data that they review. Companies like Facebook and Google have huge amounts of data and they are not sharing it. We need to find ways to make sure that data is used for the sake of the whole community and not just for the benefit of these companies. That comes to the very important point of the democratic oversight of these powerful companies. Though they are well intentioned and I have a great deal of admiration for their founders, they are not necessarily going to do things that are in the interest of the community. They may do things that will boost their share prices, which is why governments are talking about exercising control over the hi-tech companies. This is going to be the big battles of the next few years."

These dark themes were explored by this year’s Super Bowl commercials, with brands such as TurboTax, Olay and Sprint capitalizing on fears that technology is encroaching on our lives. The unspoken subject of many of the ads: Amazon.com Inc.’s Alexa, an increasingly ubiquitous digital assistant sold by one of the world’s most powerful companies.


Amazon had its own commercial, where it poked fun at Alexa. The ad featured rejected ideas for the technology -- including a microwave, dog collar and hot tub -- and even depicted a massive power outage triggered by Alexa.


Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos also made an in-person appearance at the Super Bowl, where he was spotted with National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell.


The Super Bowl’s advertisers included companies seeking to disrupt the TV industry. Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube TV sponsored the game’s kickoff show, and Hulu and Netflix aired commercials.

"Xiaomi initially targeted Asian markets, notably India, where it toppled Samsung as the No.1 smartphone seller last year


BARCELONA: China's Xiaomi has launched its contribution to a new wave of smartphones that will be able to take advantage of faster 5G mobile networks at a lower price than analysts expect from rivals such as Samsung.


The world's fourth-largest smartphone maker unveiled the handset on Sunday, trumpeting prices starting from 599 euros ($680) when it hits the market in May, prompting gasps in the hall at the mobile industry's biggest global event in Barcelona."
"Note that the margins dipped compared to the December quarter (14.1%) as well. On the whole, Hero MotoCorp’s operating performance was disappointing. The 8% drop in net revenue, along with weak profitability, led to a 22% year-on-year drop in Ebitda to ?1,069 crore.


Worse, the management has already voiced concerns on the outlook for the year ahead. In a post-results call with analysts, it forecast a mid-single digit growth in revenue for FY20. Of course, much depends on a pickup in sales during the festive season and the ability of the consumer to adjust to higher product prices. After all, the price hike on account of new insurance regulations has hurt two-wheeler consumer sentiment since August 2018, following which growth has steadily slowed."

"That’s because low inflation has been driven by falling food prices, cutting farmer incomes and pushing up debt levels. About 800 million of India’s 1.3 billion population depend on farming for their livelihood.


“While Modi has managed to keep inflation under control, it has come at a cost,"" said Priyanka Kishore, head India and South-east Asia economist at Oxford Economics in Singapore. “Falling rural incomes and farm distress have taken the shine off one of the key achievements of the Modi government.""


On the plus side, the slowdown in inflation raises the prospect of another interest-rate cut in April, providing Modi with a much-needed boost to the Indian economy. The Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based retail inflation rose 2.57% in February, compared with a median estimate of 2.4% in a Bloomberg survey, but well below the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI's) medium-term inflation target of 4%.

"Apple accuses Qualcomm, which holds the most patents for chips, of taking advantage of its dominant position to charge exorbitant amounts for its chips or access to its patents.


The iPhone maker refuses to pay up and is also seeking what could be billions of dollars in compensation.


Qualcomm denies the allegations and accuses Apple of abusing its position and of taking legal action to negotiate prices down.


After jury selection in the San Diego federal court, arguments are expected to begin Tuesday. Apple chief Tim Cook and Qualcomm's CEO Steve Mollenkopf are both expected to appear during the trial, which is set to last around a month.


The stakes are high for Qualcomm, which earns a significant chunk of its revenue from royalties paid by manufacturers for its patented technology.


""In order to purchase Qualcomm chips or obtain access to patents pledged to a cellular standard, Qualcomm demands that third parties pay Qualcomm a royalty much greater than the value of Qualcomm's contribution to the standard,"" Apple argues."

The high refresh rate panel will not only aid in gaming performance, but will even make general navigation through the UI much more snappy and fun. And given the fact that OnePlus has never launched a device in the recent past with an LCD display, it might as well be the first AMOLED display glued onto a smartphone sporting a high refresh-rate."

"What’s helping these creators is that companies like LG, Samsung, Microsoft, Apple and Google have specifically-highlighted features in their devices that cater to such needs. For instance, the Samsung Galaxy S10 has specific camera features that are meant for creators. Similarly, LG’s V series devices have often been marketed as phones that are suited for those who earn a living by making YouTube videos.


Rohit Gupta , who is one of the founders of The Creative Indians, has shot the entire fourth season of their show using the iPhone XS Max. “We started our experiments with the iPhone 8 and then X and eventually XS Max. We have done a run-through from the iPhone 7 to the XS Max,"" he says, adding that when they shoot, they don’t look at the phone as a replacement for the camera but “try to shoot within the pros of the phone’s camera"". According to him, while phones may not allow the versatility that traditional cameras do, they allow the creator to introduce a different “language"", which he prefers.


To be sure, creators agree that it’s important to understand the limitations of mobile devices. For instance, Gupta says the smaller camera sensors on phones means you have to be more thorough with your lighting and “throw that much more light on the sensor"". Also, phone cameras do not provide the depth that a full-fledged camera gives.


Similarly, Khan says that while his iPad works fine for his Instagram posts, he has had to move to the PC when designing billboards or other larger resolution images. “This task is something that will require proper professional software and tools.

"Gandhi has represented Amethi for three consecutive terms. BJP has fielded Irani again, a strong orator who tears into the Gandhi family each time she takes the stage. Nepotism, corruption and the neglect of the constituency are her main talking points.


“The choice of Irani is significant because the party wants to focus on how this high-profile constituency of the senior-most Congress leader is in bad shape. She talks about development and dynastic rule, and puts the focus on things that have been ignored for so long in Amethi,"" said a senior BJP leader from the state.


She appeals to a section of voters who feel the constituency has been ignored and needs a non-Congress, non-Gandhi representative. “Amethi is worse than it used to be. We have nothing compared to the kind of work that Modi has done. Irani is a strong candidate and will do well this time,"" said Heera Soni, a jewellery shop owner in Amethi.


Across UP, and large parts of north India, Congress’ inability to firm up alliances has impacted its chances and left voters uncertain. In UP, Congress is not part of the Samjawadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party combine. In contrast, BJP had a fairly smooth ride with its allies. In states like Bihar, it ceded space to allies in order to create formidable combinations.


“It is a make or break election for the Congress. They have staked everything on it. Rahul Gandhi needs to win Amethi and Congress needs to do well in the Lok Sabha elections. If one or the other does not happen, it will cast a shadow on the future of both,"" said Ram Prasad, who supplies hardware material in Amethi.


After losing to the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Congress faced its roughest electoral run in the following years. In 2014, Congress won only Amethi and Rae Bareli of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP. Three years later, in the assembly elections it could not improve its performance, and won only seven out of the 114 assembly seats it contested."

Zuckerberg in March promised changes to the advertising-driven social media company, which has come under regulatory scrutiny over propaganda on its platform and violations of users' data privacy.


He identified private messaging, short-lasting stories and small groups as the fastest-growing areas of online communication. In the last three years, the number of people using Facebook's WhatsApp has almost doubled.


Building up those more intimate and encrypted forms of communication could also reduce pressure on Facebook to clean up misinformation and abusive content. In the wake of its scandals, the company has spent heavily on tools to catch banned material.

The Nifty PSE index is down 22% in the past two years, as compared to a 16% rise in the Nifty 500 index. Stocks in the Nifty PSE are down between 15.2% and 41% in the past two years. Of course, the financial performance of firms run by the government is nothing to write home about, which is in itself a major reason for the underperformance. But an increase in free float is a concern as well.


A case in point is the Coal India Ltd stock, which is down 34.9% in the past two years. In a recent report, Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd cited continuous selling by promoters as a key concern on the Coal India stock price. “Government of India (GoI) has sold shares worth ?34,110 crore (in the past five years), bringing down promoter’s holding to ~72% (from 90% earlier). This has been a continuous pressure on the stock performance amid overall weakness in the stock market,"" note analysts at Motilal Oswal in a note to clients."

"Further, the government’s 100 smart cities project, Digital India programme, Make in India project and Smart Energy project are expected to proliferate the deployment of IoT devices in India. The government is also partnering with start-ups and mentoring them to develop innovative solutions in areas such as education tech, healthcare tech, e-governance, finance and agriculture. Besides, sensors inside offshore drilling rigs constantly monitor the performance of gas turbines for damages as well as regulate the pressure of the oil below the ocean surface.


The complexity of the IoT system, however, requires essential rules on data management, security, latency and reliability issues. Besides, IoT will require AI as a companion since IoT will produce a treasure trove of big data that will need to be intelligently analysed with machine learning to draw meaningful insights for businesses.


Three-dimensional (3-D) printing is changing the face of traditional manufacturing. Today, 3-D printers not only make jewellery and toothbrushes but also football boots, racing-car parts, custom-designed cakes, human organs, houses, aeroplane parts and even more efficient lithium-ion batteries. And yes! They even provide blueprints for 3D-printed guns.


Last month, a US federal judge blocked defdist.org from sharing blueprints of 3-D guns. However, the ruling came after thousands of people had already downloaded blueprints for these weapons. As a precautionary measure, some 3-D printing firms are now using gun-blocking software to deter people from printing functional guns, according to a 14 August report by radio programme producer NPR.


According to 6Wresearch, India’s 3-D printer market is projected to touch $79 million by 2021. The growth triggers include the low cost of manufacturing, increased applications and the Make In India campaign. In India, 3-D printers have been used in medical, architecture, automotive, industrial, aerospace, military and other applications, where automotive application accounts for the largest revenue and volume share.


Four years ago, for instance, a team of Indian plastic surgeons at the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (Jipmer) in Puducherry restored the deformed skull of a three-year-old girl to its original shape with the help of a 3-D printer that was sourced from a Mumbai-based 3-D printer maker, Divide By Zero Technologies. Jipmer now has its own 3-D Printer.


3-D printing belongs to a class of techniques known as additive manufacturing, or building objects layer by layer. The most common household 3D-printing process involves a “print head"", which allows for any material from plastic (and now metals too) to be extruded or squirted through a nozzle. To be sure, there’s also the concept of 4-D printing, which allows materials to “self-assemble"" into 3-D structures, and which was initially proposed by Skylar Tibbits of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in April 2013.


Globally, the 3-D printer market is expected to be worth $32.78 billion by 2023, according to research firm Markets and Markets. The aerospace and defence vertical, according to the report, held the largest share of the global 3-D printing market in 2016."

The outcome boosts Qualcomm’s contention that its technology provides significant value to smartphones beyond the basic ability to connect to a telecommunications network. Still, it’s one small part of a global battle between the companies that is headed for a bigger test next month. Billions of dollars are at stake in that trial, which goes to the heart of the licensing dispute between the tech giants."

"But all of these positives will not guarantee a deal. The company’s operations have scaled down, considering that about half of its planes are grounded.

Returning to normalcy can be an uphill task, especially with some competitors successful in poaching some of the airline’s resources. Even before Jet Airways’ current troubles, its cost structure was far higher than that of its peers.


Cumulatively, these factors could well mean that Jet Airways’ sale will not take off easily. Investors are taking note of this. Small wonder then that despite the rally in its shares on Monday, the stock is still trading 58% lower compared to the beginning of FY19.


So, when banks try to find a strategic investor for Jet Airways within the next two months, their only hope is of others who have similar nerves of steel. Else, their latest show of support will be a case of false bravado."

The Vodafone Idea Ltd combine continues to rationalise its telecom sites. After exiting the overlapping sites, the focus now is on reducing the presence in low-revenue generating sites.


The second is Reliance Jio’s plans to float its tower infrastructure business into a separate entity. Analysts fear such a move can curb incremental tenancies from Jio. The scenario can deteriorate if the new entity created by Jio is successful in finding external customers. This can exert pricing pressure, impacting Bharti Infratel’s prospects further."

"What lies ahead for organizations?: Experts at Checkpoint believe there will be more targeted attacks in the future as cybercriminals are eyeing higher returns. Cloud infrastructure will face more Cryptojacking attacks (unauthorized use of someone else’s computer to mine cryptocurrency) as hackers will require assets that offer greater CPU capacity for faster mining and the scalability of cloud services will allow them to do that. Also, many organizations are still not fully aware of its crippling effects, notes Checkpoint. Attacks on mobile devices are also expected to grow, but instead of multiple forms of attacks, cybercriminals may use an all-in-one mobile malware with multiple capabilities, it notes. Further, with artificial intelligence (AI) becoming an integral part of operations of many organizations, cybercriminals will try to manipulate AI systems. IoT devices, on their part, are predicted to remain the weakest link in security as they are harder to secure.


Moreover, following the roll-out of general data protection regulations in the European Union, more countries are going to come up with their own data protection laws. This means organizations won’t be able to brush away any data breaches involving user data and will have to make them public."

Planning to buy the Apple iPhone XR? You would save at least $250 and still get most of the other cutting-edge features found on the more expensive model


New York: Apple offers you a simple trade-off with its new iPhone XR, the middlebrow cousin to the top-of-the-line iPhone XS.


On one hand, the XR lacks the high-resolution screen and dual-lens camera found on the XS. On the other, you'd save at least $250 and still get most of the other cutting-edge features found on the more expensive model.


Based on several days of testing, it looks like Apple made the right cost-cutting trade-offs with the XR, which starts selling Friday for about $750. The standard XS starts at about $1,000; its supersized cousin, the XS Max, goes for $100 more."

Jharkhand is one of the few states where the understanding among the coalition challenging the BJP is strong.


The current government has done very well in certain areas. For example, it succeeded in cracking down on Naxalism. In this election, Naxalism therefore, is not an issue.

Similarly, Pimco was a big buyer of Treasury futures in the 1980s. Clients heard “futures"" and asked, “Is this like soybeans? Are you trading corn?"" Gross recalled. As a result, the spreads between the cash and futures markets were unusually wide and created a “sort of riskless arbitrage.""


Gross put himself ahead by identifying opportunities to take risk outside the bonds in his benchmark and using the Pimco sales force to get clients comfortable with the approach.

“Anytime someone is collecting where you are, that means it could go to someone else who could find you when you don’t want to be found,"" she said. Widespread access to location data associated with Alexa user recordings “would set up a big red flag for me.""


In an April 10 statement acknowledging the Alexa auditing program, Amazon said “employees do not have direct access to information that can identify the person or account as part of this workflow.""


In a new statement responding to this story, Amazon said “access to internal tools is highly controlled, and is only granted to a limited number of employees who require these tools to train and improve the service by processing an extremely small sample of interactions. Our policies strictly prohibit employee access to or use of customer data for any other reason, and we have a zero tolerance policy for abuse of our systems.

Xiaomi has been a bit stingy in the memory department, though. The entry-level variant offers just 2GB RAM, which can be a bit low for users who like to multi-task on their phones.


Users can always expand the storage with a micro-SD card and Xiaomi has kept the card slot separate from the dual-SIM slots, so one can use all three simultaneously.

"That means the real problem may be not so much WhatsApp the company or WhatsApp the product but something more fundamental — WhatsApp the idea.


When you offer everyone access to free and private communication, lots of wonderful things may happen — and WhatsApp has been a godsend to vulnerable populations like migrants, dissidents and political activists. But a lot of terrible things are bound to happen, too — and it might be impossible to eliminate the bad without muzzling the good.


In this light, WhatsApp is a powerful and permanent new reality and its problems aren’t likely to be solved as much as fitfully and sometimes unsatisfyingly managed. For better or worse, we are going to have to learn to live with it.


“I thought WhatsApp would be a very dark place, a wild place, where all these conspiracy theories would be spreading and we wouldn’t know what they were talking about,"" said Yasodara Córdova, a fellow at DigitalHKS, a center at Harvard’s Kennedy School that examines the role digital technologies play in government. Córdova has been working on Comprova, a fact-checking project to monitor social media sites during Brazil’s election.


What sets WhatsApp apart is speed and reach, Córdova said. In Brazil, more than 120 million people use the service, which is offered free as part of mobile internet plans (that is, using WhatsApp does not count against people’s data rate). As it does in its other big markets — India, South Africa, Saudi Arabia and much of Europe — WhatsApp functions in Brazil as an all-purpose communications tool. It is used for chatting and joking, for trading photos and memes, for news, for political activity and more.


Because of that centrality, Córdova argued, the problems on WhatsApp in Brazil were mainly a function of the country’s broken political and media environment.


“For example, we don’t really have public libraries in Brazil,"" she said. “We don’t have a lot of sources of what people would consider reliable information — and the lack of good sources of information reinforces their beliefs when they see something false on WhatsApp or Facebook."""

After the changes, a Facebook user, for instance, will be able send an encrypted message to someone who has only a WhatsApp account


San Francisco: Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, plans to integrate the social network’s messaging services — WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger — asserting his control over the company’s sprawling divisions at a time when its business has been battered by scandals.


The move, described by four people involved in the effort, requires thousands of Facebook employees to reconfigure how WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger function at their most basic levels. While all three services will continue operating as stand-alone apps, their underlying messaging infrastructure will be unified, the people said. Facebook is still in the early stages of the work and plans to complete it by the end of this year or in early 2020, they said.


Zuckerberg has also ordered all of the apps to incorporate end-to-end encryption, the people said, a significant step that protects messages from being viewed by anyone except the participants in the conversation. After the changes take effect, a Facebook user could send an encrypted message to someone who has only a WhatsApp account, for example. Currently, that isn’t possible because the apps are separate.


By stitching the apps’ infrastructure together, Zuckerberg wants to increase the utility of the social network, keeping its billions of users highly engaged inside its ecosystem. If people turn more regularly to Facebook-owned properties for texting, they may forgo rival messaging services, such as those from Apple and Google, said the people, who declined to be identified because the moves are confidential. If users interact more frequently with Facebook’s apps, the company may also be able to build up its advertising business or add new services to make money, they said."

"In August, Epic said it wouldn’t distribute Fortnite through Google’s Play Store, instead asking players to visit its own site and download a special launcher that would open the game on Android devices. The method allows Epic to avoid the commission fee, and it’s new store will work in a similar fashion. Still, the game maker will have to assure players that its app store is as secure as the ones operated by Apple and Google.


If Apple and Google are eventually forced to cut commissions to match Epic’s, it could severely impact profit, Schachter said. Though the companies don’t break out financial information for their stores, research firm Sensor Tower said in a July report that people spent around $34 billion on the stores in the first half of 2018."
"Besides, the government’s aggressive divestment spree in these past two years has constantly kept the supply taps open in many PSE counters. The chosen route of divestment has been either exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or open market sales, or follow-on share offerings.


The sales are often lapped up because of a discount offered, although institutional investors typically hedge their bets by taking short positions in the derivatives market. Soon after allotment, the position is flipped (bit.ly/2GFs22t), and anecdotal evidence suggests the majority of the chunk of the incremental free float is held by retail investors, either directly or through investments in mutual funds or EPFO (Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation).


A recent Mint report said ETFs comprising PSE stocks have generated dismal returns for EPFO (bit.ly/2In50OB). The government’s aggressive disinvestment seems to be resulting in an egregious form of wealth transfer, with retail investors getting the short end of the stick."
"The foldable screens could increase display space to the size of a mini-tablet, but fold like a wallet. Image: Bloomberg


Samsung and several rivals are preparing to roll out such screens to make devices more versatile for work and pleasure


San Francisco: For the past few years, the smartphone industry has been searching for a breakthrough to revive a market mired in an innovation lull and a sales slump. A potential catalyst is on the horizon in the form of flexible screens that can be folded in half without breaking. Samsung and several rivals are preparing to roll out such screens to make devices more versatile for work and pleasure.

Reports and rumours hint at the presence of a curved, notch-less, high refresh-rate display. We are talking figures of 90Hz, which will put the OnePlus 7 Pro, a consumer-centric device, straight up in the league of gaming smartphones like the Razer Phone 2 and Asus' ROG Phone."
"""There is no legal mechanism to stop misuse of facial recognition technology in India,"" Pavan Duggal, one of the nation's top cyberlaw experts, told IANS, adding that the Information Technology Act does not specially deal with misuse of this technology.


There is also not any blanket ban on the use of this technology, perhaps because of the benefits that could accrue from the proper usage of the technology that dramatically cuts down the amount of time needed for identifying people or objects in photos and video.


In April last year, for example, Delhi Police could identify almost 3,000 missing children in just four days during a trial of a facial recognition system.


While the benefits of the technology for law enforcement agencies in fighting crime and identifying missing people and also for the industry for business purposes cannot be denied, it is the misuse of the technology that can put the citizens of the country in trouble."
"Part of the reason for the stock’s stagnation is concerns over its ability to drive further margin expansion. Raw material prices have been stable largely due to the drop in food prices. “One of the big concerns is food inflation. Rising raw material prices will tend to impact margins,"" says Naveen Kulkarni, head of research at Reliance Securities.


A larger concern is the rich stock valuations, due to higher demand for consumer goods stocks. In March 2015, Britannia’s one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio used to be about 35 times. Currently, it is 51.8 times, which is 48% higher. Unless it can bake healthy growth rates in the future, investors might soon find the stock unappetizing."

"However, banning TikTok may not completely put it behind the reach of children, feels Pavan Duggal, leading cyberlaw expert. He points out, “Banning the app is completely out of sync with today's time. Even if the app is banned, people can still download them from other sources or by changing their location. We are not understanding the bigger challenge of how to deal with the paradigm. The problem is not with the app but third-party content. Strict action needs to be taken against people publishing such content instead of asking for a blanket ban on apps.""


Also, in the absence of the app from legitimate and trusted sources, users may turn to web based third-party stores, which can be more dangerous as they do not verify apps for hidden malicious content as Google and Apple do."

"The draft amendment proposes that intermediaries will have to hand over to governmentagencies any information that might be related to cyber security, national security and related with the investigation, prosecution or prevention of an offence, within 72 hours.


They will have to take down or disable content considered defamatory or against national security under Article 19 (2) of the Constitution within 24 hours on being notified by the appropriate government or its agency in addition to using automated tools to identify, remove and trace the origin of such content. Intermediaries with over 55 lakh users will be required to have a permanent registered office with physical address and a senior official who would be available for coordination with law enforcement agencies.


Microsoft notes that the problem MEITY is trying to address is of fake news. “Existing regulations provide enough powers to work with social media platforms. There may be a case to bring out additional guidelines for certain types of intermediaries like social media platforms. There may also be a case to strengthen other laws which make the punishment of fake news and misuse of social media stringent. The focus should be on the perpetrators of the crime rather than the intermediaries,"" it has said in response to the guidelines. Regarding deployment of tools to proactively identify and remove unlawful content, Microsoft cautions that intermediaries will have to monitor all content passing through their systems for this, which is a violation of their individual privacy and right to freedom of expression. It will also be technically impractical due to the high cost of deploying such tech.


According to Broadband India Forum, one of the grounds for the Supreme Court striking down Section 66A of the IT Act, 2000, in Shreya Singhal vs Union of India was the vagueness of the terms used in the provision, such as offensive, menacing and dangerous, which invaded the right of free speech.

"The company also unveiled the Galaxy S10 5G, its first phone to work with 5G networks, which will have a jumbo 6.7-inch screen. In addition, it showed the Galaxy S10E, a model with a 5.8-inch display in a body that is smaller than the S9’s, for people who prefer more compact devices.


Why would you want a bigger screen? When upgrading devices, people are increasingly gravitating toward phones with larger displays. Many feel that they are getting more bang for the buck with bigger screens, as studies have shown that people spend more time using apps, watching videos and browsing the web on big-screen phones.


Samsung first showed a prototype of its foldable phone at a conference for software developers last year. When folded up, it looked like a phone with a small screen, and once unfolded, the screen doubled in size.


At a media event on Wednesday, Samsung shared some details about its foldable device, Galaxy Fold. It has two screens — a smaller one and a larger one — with a hinge in the middle containing multiple interlocking gears. When folded up, the viewable screen measures 4.6 inches. Unfolding the device reveals its 7.3-inch display, which is the size of a tablet screen.


Samsung said it was working with Google, YouTube and others to develop apps that seamlessly transition between a single screen when folded up and the double screens in unfolded mode.


You may want a foldable phone if you love tablet computers. Plenty of people enjoy using tablets like Apple’s iPad and Amazon’s Fire Tablet for their roomy screens that are upward of 7 inches diagonally. That makes watching videos, reading books and playing games more enjoyable. The downside is that tablets are so large that they aren’t pocketable. A foldable phone, in theory, will let people have a tablet that can be folded up and carried in a pocket.


Other phone-makers are expected to jump on this trend. Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, posted an image on Twitter this month teasing a foldable phone that will be unveiled at Mobile World Congress, the tech trade show in Barcelona, next week.


Foldable phones raise plenty of questions. When folded, the device becomes thicker in the pocket, which might make it bulky and uncomfortable. And it’s unclear whether making the displays bendable also makes them more fragile when dropped."
"On the face of it, India already has the basic foundations of a social security system. The public distribution system (PDS) provides a modicum of food and economic security to 67% of the population under the National Food Security Act, 2013. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (MGNREGA) gives every rural household an opportunity to earn a basic wage on local public works, for up to 100 days in the year.


Social security pensions are in place for the elderly, widows and disabled persons. Maternity benefits of ?6,000 per child are a legal right of all Indian women under the National Food Security Act. Most children receive nutrition supplements and health services under the Mid Day Meal Scheme and the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS).


In practice, this safety net is still rife with holes. The PDS, despite considerable improvement in recent years, remains prone to leakages and exclusion errors. MGNREGA employment is far from “guaranteed"", even to those who make a formal application for it. The coverage of social security pensions is still very patchy in many states. Maternity benefits have been illegally restricted, under the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), to the first living child.


Further, all these schemes have low benefits: MGNREGA wage rates are below the minimum wage in many states; PMMVY benefits have been reduced (illegally again) to ?5,000 per child; the central government’s contribution to social security pensions has stagnated at a measly ?200 per month for more than 12 years, and so on.


Against this background, the NYAY promise deserves serious consideration, as a means of plugging the holes and enhancing the benefits.


However, NYAY is both an opportunity and a threat. A well-planned NYAY, integrated with other foundations of India’s social security system, could be the next leap forward. But if NYAY displaces or undermines the existing foundations of social security without putting something better in place, it could also turn into a bull in the china shop.


For convenience, I shall use a prescriptive tone, but the intention is just to float some ideas for discussion.


FIRST, NYAY is best recognized for what it is: a massive pension scheme. The initial idea was to guarantee a minimum income ( ?12,000 per month according to Congress president Rahul Gandhi) by filling the gap, household-wise, between minimum income and actual income. This “top-up"" approach, however, is impractical. On 25 March 2019, it gave way to the “flat-rate"" approach, where all recipients get the same unconditional benefit of ?6,000 per month. In that case, NYAY might as well be seen as a pension scheme—taking the word “pension"" in the broad sense of a basic income allowance, not necessarily restricted to those who are unable to work.


SECOND, the “6x20"" formula ( ?6,000 a month for 20% of the population) should not be treated as a sacrosanct prescription, but as a benchmark for the commitment being made to this pension scheme. If something roughly equivalent but more effective is possible, it should be considered."

"Similarly, this February, mobile security expert App Analyst discovered that iOS apps of some of the leading travel companies, such as Expedia, Hotels.com, Hollister and Air Canada, were secretly recording displays using a session-replay technology, which allows the app developer to capture every activity on the phone’s screen while the app was open. The recording was forwarded to analytics firm Glassbox for a deeper examination of how users were interacting with the apps so that they could identify the pain points and address them. The data gathering was carried out without the knowledge of users. In some cases, the apps were also found to be capturing passport info and credit card numbers of users as well.


One of the apps was by Air Canada, which had reported a data breach affecting more than 20,000 users in August 2018. Experts feel that if hackers had gained access to these sessions the situation could have been worse. “There can be good reasons for session replay analytics as it allows those companies to see, for example, which of their options are most used so that they can then make them more accessible. However, doing that without even mentioning it (so that the user at least knows that this is being done), is not right and probably illegal in some countries,"" Luis Corrons, security evangelist, Avast Software, pointed out in an official post.


Apple is simply a case in point. According to a July 2018 study from Northeastern University, Boston, security researchers found several Android apps secretly taking screenshots and video recordings of displays, and forwarding them to mobile analytics firms. It’s hardly a surprise, then, that a majority of smartphone users believe that many apps secretly listen to their conversations in a bid to target them with contextual advertisements."

"In recent months, the messaging app has raised frightening new political and social dynamics. Photo: Bloomberg


The real problem may be not so much WhatsApp the company or WhatsApp the product but something more fundamental — WhatsApp the idea


Should the world worry about WhatsApp? Has it become a virulent new force in global misinformation and political trickery?


Or, rather, should the world rejoice about WhatsApp? After all, hasn’t it provided a way for people everywhere to communicate securely with encrypted messages, beyond the reach of government surveillance?


In recent months, the messaging app, which is owned by Facebook and has more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, has raised frightening new political and social dynamics. In Brazil, which is in a bruising national election campaign, WhatsApp has become a primary vector for conspiracy theories and other political misinformation. WhatsApp played a similar role in Kenya’s election last year. In India this year, false messages about child kidnappers went viral on WhatsApp, leading to mob violence that has killed dozens of people.


WhatsApp said it was working to reduce the spread of misinformation on the service. Critics charge that it is not doing enough — and there is some merit to their claims. Yet the deeper you dig into the problems, the more intractable they can come to seem, even if the company were moving heaven and earth to fix them.


Unlike Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, WhatsApp isn’t a social network. It is mostly a bare-bones texting app in which most conversations are private and unmediated by any kind of algorithm meant to amp up engagement. This design means WhatsApp has little control over what content takes off and what doesn’t; in most cases, the company cannot even see what is happening on WhatsApp because the service encrypts messages automatically."

"Most cheaters try to manipulate games using DLL injection. A Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file contains code and data that can be simultaneously used by multiple programs.


Cheaters first access the system memory by placing a DLL file into the game process forcefully and then use the access to modify game related information. By modifying these codes, cheaters can gain unfair advantage by adding options like seeing opponents even when they are not in sight, or locking on a target in first attempt.


The company is using two third-party solutions, BattlEye and Uncheater, to protect the game process area. In addition to these, they are using machine learning models that first studies players’ usage patterns and then uses the markers to detect abnormal game patterns or actions.


They are verified and then banned from the game. The patterns used by unauthorised programs are periodically updated to ensure programs which have been blocked do not try to bypass the solution with modifications."
"So what does look like a shower of sparks? Here’s Hill again: “When a helicopter descends into a sandy environment, the enormous downward thrust from the blades inevitably kicks up a cloud of sand. Cutting through the sand and dust, the blades smash into millions of these tiny particles, each sandblasting metal from the blade…Every so often, the metal blasted from the blades produces a miniature meteor shower…When a helicopter’s blades begin cutting through a cloud of sand, the particles hit the blades and send bits of metal flying into the air.""


That’s right: The halos are caused by tiny shards of pyrophoric metal, igniting spontaneously as they fly through the air. The same phenomenon, that is, that’s at work in cigarette lighters and flintlock rifles and bits of metal that decrepit old cars drag behind them.


There in war-torn Afghanistan, Michael Yon captured a gorgeous visual treat that was, for him, simultaneously a reminder of the beauty in science and the despair of war. Yet while the pilots and soldiers around him were familiar with it, they had no name for it. On his blog, he asked: “How can the helicopter halos, so majestic and indeed dangerous at times, be devoid of a fitting name?""


So he came up with his own name. At about the time he was photographing these silky helicopter halos, two young soldiers died in combat in Helmand: An American, Benjamin Kopp, and an Englishman, Joseph Etchells. For Yon, the halos were almost like a tribute to them and all the deaths in this war he had witnessed so closely. He writes: “And so a fitting name had arrived to describe the halo glow we sometimes see in Helmand Province.""


The Kopp-Etchells Effect, then. A reminder that in the wrenching tragedy of war, sometimes you stumble on a touch of beauty.

Company employees in Washington knew the firm’s activities were a “a problem,"" Rock said, calling it “material information that should be disclosed to consumers.""


The incursions started in 2013, about 18 months before Facebook employees began discussing them in a string of email messages Racine’s office submitted with court papers, the company’s lawyer said.


“Facebook was not aware of the transfer of data from Kogan/GSR to Cambridge Analytica until December 2015, as we have testified under oath,"" a Facebook spokesperson said in an email to Bloomberg News on Friday, referring to the creator of the app that mined Facebook user data and shared it with Cambridge.

In the eyes of law, they are treated as an expert,"" says DCP M.N. Anuchet, the chief investigating officer in the Gauri Lankesh murder case.


Beyond the realm of gait itself, law enforcement agencies are increasingly turning to technology during an investigation. While technologies like Mobile Signal Triangulation which can pinpoint a suspect’s location at the time of crime based on cellphone call records have begun to be deployed on a regular basis, newer tools like gait analysis, AI-backed face recognition, or machine learning tools to predict violent behaviour by a crowd are slowly gaining acceptance.


Delhi Police recently announced plans to use cutting-edge technology in investigations and has roped in the Indraprastha Institute of Technology Delhi (IIIT-D) for assistance. The institute has set up a Centre for Technology and Policing, “which will help Delhi Police by providing them with the latest tools for interrogation, surveillance, and tracking along with research assistance in the field of biometrics, image processing, and forensic science,"" said Ranjan Bose, director, IIIT-D.


Advances in technology will also cut down the time spent on long-winded processes, which impedes investigative swiftness.


A case in point is the use of a Rapid DNA machine by the Bensalem police department in Philadelphia in the US. It can analyze DNA samples and give results in 90 minutes, unlike accredited labs which handle multiple forensic DNA analyses and take days to give results. These machines are as big as a desktop PC, which makes installing them easy, and can be operated by the police officials themselves. They use a cartridge, which costs $150, for every DNA analysis. Permitted by the US government, the machines will be installed in more police stations across the country. These machines can come in very handy in a country like India where the lack of DNA testing infrastructure and manpower has led to a serious backlog of unexamined DNA samples.


According to the Directorate of Forensic Science Services (DFSS) data, DNA samples from 12,072 sexual assault cases were waiting for examination in three of the six central forensic science laboratories which had the facility to test the samples, as on December 2017.


Machine learning is also being used now to assist in policing. Students at IIT Madras, for instance, have developed an AI-based crowd analysis tool which uses action recognition algorithms, crowd density maps, and analysis of live images captured by CCTV cameras to predict violent behaviour like stone pelting. The tool was showcased at Army Technology Seminar 2019 in Delhi by the IIT students.


Another AI-driven initiative in this area has come from a Gurgaon-based startup Staqu. The company has been working with several state police departments. One of their solutions, called Smart Glass, which is in pilot stage, uses facial recognition tools to auto-scan the faces and look up in a database for probable matches. The ability to faces via the Trinetra app has already come in handy to bust criminal gangs in UP. “Staqu’s platform has not only helped us build a centralized database which includes the photos and history of all the criminals who are in and out of prison but has also made our operations much easier. Within seconds, we can verify if a person has a criminal record or not,"" says SK Bhagat, IG, Lucknow range.

We took a private photo with a gift just given to us - we should have been more thoughtful,"" she said in a tweet. “Twitter strives to be an impartial platform for all. We failed to do that here & we must do better to serve our customers in India.""

"For that matter, even the relaxation of tax on notional rent of unsold housing units held by the developer for 24 months (from the earlier 12 months) will give marginal relief. The share of ready-to-move, unsold residential units is a small portion of the total unsold inventory, say analysts at Crisil. This means that very few firms in the listed universe would gain from this tax relaxation. Besides, the earlier outgo on this front was not very high in any case.


The need of the hour is to propel demand for homes. Budgetary incentives such as raising personal income- tax exemption limit to ?5 lakh from ?2.5 lakh, higher standard deduction, higher taxable limit for rental income from homes and allowing capital gains proceeds to be reinvested in two homes instead of one (in a lifetime) may motivate homebuyers to own a second unit.


But tax incentives alone will not suffice. Demand revival in the sector will come from lower interest rates that would make monthly equated instalments more affordable. The trigger will ideally come from rate cuts by the central bank. Further, the tightness in liquidity due to the non-banking financial companies’ crisis is yet to ease. Meanwhile, property prices are still sticky in most parts of the country, which may also put buyers of a second home on the back foot."

It will also be a test for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which will aim to defend the maximum number of seats at 62


Gujarat being the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP would again look for clean sweep in the state


The third phase of Lok Sabha elections scheduled for Tuesday will see the maximum number of seats going to the polls in a single phase -- 117 across 15 states and Union Territories.


It will also be a test for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which will aim to defend the maximum number of seats at 62.


In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP had won 62 of the 115 seats in the third phase, and its performance in this phase will be crucial in deciding its political fortunes.


The Congress had won 16 seats, while the remaining seats were divided between BJD (6), CPI-M (7), NCP (4), Samajwadi Party (3), Shiv Sena (2), RJD (2), AIUDF (2), IUML (2), LJP (1), PDP (1), RSP (1), Kerala Congress-M (1), CPI (1), Swabhimani Paksha (1) and Trinamool Congress (1). Three seats were won by Independent candidates.


This time the BJP will be tested in its bastion Gujarat -- where polling will be held for all the 26 Lok Sabha seats in the state -- apart from Karanataka, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh, where the party had done well in 2014."

Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth, if and when he chooses to contest, may find that star power is no longer enough on the Tamil Nadu electoral scene. “Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan will have to deliver if they want us to keep voting for them. See what happened to Vijayakanth,"" said a 45-year-old auto driver, Rajan. He was referring to Vijayakanth’s Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam, which made its debut in the 2006 assembly polls and captured a 10% vote share.

Across the city, there is, of course, the oft-repeated refrain of exhaustion with the two main Dravidian parties. “I’m tired of having to choose between the AIADMK and the DMK,"" said Yesuraj, a cab driver. “I’m glad Kamal Haasan and T.T.V. are options even if they turn out to be no different over time."""

It was one of the key promises of the government that has been in power and they have failed the people,"" Vadra said.


According to the Press Trust of India, the leather business in Kanpur was worth ?12,000 crore. And now, tertiary businesses are also getting affected.


“Before the shut down, we used to work six days a week to make leather shoes. That has now been reduced to four days because the leather supply has reduced,"" Miraj Khan, a labourer at a shoemaking factory in Sisamau in the Kanpur constituency, said.


For Ravi Gaur, 28, a trader from Kidwai Nagar in Kanpur, the implementation of GST and the impact of demonetization has affected him. “Traders have been very worried. Though GST may have made the process smooth, increasing costs have led to a sharp decline in sales. When demonetization was implemented, it was a good step, but it is beginning to impact the market now,"" he added."
"The party chief in Kerala, PS Sreedharan Pillai, said as much—in an internal meet of the party's youth outfit, he said it is the ""golden chance"" for the BJP to grow. But as poll contest nears, Sabarimala is giving much of the pain for the party in the candidate's selection process.


Even as the ruling communists and the Congress, the later even after some unusual delay, have announced candidates, the BJP camp still seems to be in the dark about its candidates in Kerala, except for fielding Kummanam Rajashekaran against Congress heavyweight Shashi Tharoor in Thiruvananthapuram.


Rajashekaran, a former party president, resigned as Mizoram Governor on 8 March in order to return to Kerala politics and has started poll campaigning in Thiruvananthapuram. The inordinate delay in other seats seems mostly because the party stands divided over who to contest from Sabarimala's nerve center, the Pathanamthitta constituency."

"But with the scion of the Gandhi family choosing to contest from Kerala, rather than a place like Karnataka where the Congress is locked in a direct battle with the Bharatiya Janata Party, the equations have all toppled down. The local leaders are bristled. And they are not willing to go down in history without a pyrotechnic fight.


""This is a war and nobody should be a fence sitter. There is nothing impossible for us, we made a 50 lakh women's wall,"" said CPM boss in Kerala, Kodiyeri Balakrishnan in Malayalam, playing the local strongman image to the hilt, in an internal meet of party workers on Tuesday. A day before Gandhi’s expected arrival in Wayanad, both him and Kanam Rajendran were in the constituency, having several such meetings. Rajendran, the chief of Communist Party of India or CPI, the second biggest Left party in Kerala and whose candidate P.P. Suneer is Gandhi’s opponent.


“Everybody in India will stand up and congratulate us if we defeat Rahul Gandhi... This is a golden chance to create history. He had so far contested only from places where they have not seen Communists like us. Now, he has come to us. I say get him.

As Civis is a new platform, getting citizen feedback requires some legwork at the moment, but Vasudev hopes the platform alone will suffice in future, once the user base grows.

Civis, on the other hand, plans to depend on grants for sustaining itself in future. All three companies are bootstrapped (have invested their own money) at the moment.

For now, currency traders have put these worries on the backburner. This rupee has strengthened from lows of about 71.81/$ in mid-February to 68.94/$ at present.


Rising expectations of a stable government have helped reverse sentiment and the US Federal Reserve’s recent dovish monetary policy stance also lent a hand. Consequently, foreign investors’ interest in Indian equities revived, aiding the rupee’s relief rally.

Xiaomi is set to launch two new smartphones next week: the Redmi 7 and Redmi Note 7.

"Historically, a high voter turnout has usually benefited the main local opposition front in Kerala. Hence if the voters wanted to mark their anti-incumbency against the state-ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPM leader and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan or the center-ruling Bharatiya Janata Party or BJP leader and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the high turnout would mean a surge in the votes for the main opposition Congress-led United Democratic Front or UDF.


However, this might vary from one constituency to another. In 12 out 20 seats, the voters are voting for or against a sitting Congress MP, hence if it is local incumbency that matters, it might favour the CPM.


In any case, political parties and analysts see the turnout as a reflection of strong fight between the three fronts, which became more high profile than usual this time.


The Congress had fielded their national president Rahul Gandhi in Wayanad and expected a favourable wave across the state, especially in North Kerala regions including Wayanad. The BJP wanted to expand its vote base banking on the Sabarimala agitations, and pitched a lot of effort to open its account for the first time in Kerala by fielding former state president and Mizoram Governor Kummanam Rajasekharan against heavyweight Congress politician Shashi Tharoor in Thiruvananthapuram. The CPM-led Left Democratic Front or LDF did not make it easier for any of the opposition, by fielding their strongest local faces, as many as six MLAs, in the fray.


The constituencies which received a high turnout are indicative. Wayanad for instance marked a record polling at 80.31%, probably a result of a minority consolidation behind Congress based on the candidature of Rahul Gandhi."

"The iPhone XS now comes with dual SIM functionality. However, it will sell in two variants—one for the Chinese market and one for the rest of the world.

It requires your network provider’s support to work, though. According to a presentation slide at the Apple event, Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone were the Indian network providers that will support the eSIM functionality.

"As far as the smartphone market is concerned, the top trends revolve around multiple cameras, nearly edge-less screens and more. Foldable phones bring forth a new form factor, and could theoretically solve one of the industry’s biggest design problems—how to deliver big screens without making every phone the same brick-like device as the last.


That said, any new form factor isn’t complete without software support. So, while companies like Samsung, Huawei and others may make initial changes to their software, the real use cases will come in when developers take interest. That, traditionally happens when products start attracting enough users, and that takes time. Similarly, Google will have to fundamentally change the Android operating system to take advantage of such screens as well.


“It is likely that top smartphone brands will claim to have reinvented smartphone design because of foldable phones and screens. However, it will take longer for these foldable screens to reinvent the smartphone category and deliver differentiated experiences.

7-Eleven is the largest chain in the convenience store format globally, spread across 17 countries with more than 67,000 stores. The agreement would help Future Retail tap into 7-Eleven’s sourcing and technological expertise, says Himanshu Nayyar, analyst at Systematix Shares and Stocks (India) Ltd. This, in turn, may bring some valuable insights for the EasyDay format, too.

"However, the production function for AI may not be too difficult to measure because the relevant machine learning algorithms and their performance at different times and with different data sets are usually well-documented, at least within the companies. Research is already on to determine the marginal effect of new data on predictions, though there are several conceptual and technical questions that still need to be worked out. This could be very useful for valuing data.


The funny thing is that Data as Labour could even help the tech titans in the long term, though in the short run, their profits will be squeezed. As AI grows more advanced, it will require more and better data.


Right now, through their surveillance, companies get mostly random data. As AI services get more sophisticated, algorithms will need to be fed a higher-quality diet of digital information, which people may only provide if they get paid.


In a recent book, Radical Markets: Uprooting Capitalism and Democracy For A Just Society, Glen Weyl, an economist at Yale University, and Eric Posner of the University of Chicago, write: “Appropriate technological systems have to be developed for tracing and tracking the value created by individual users. These systems would have to balance a number of competing concerns.


On the one hand, they should try to measure which individual user is responsible for what data contributions, especially when these contributions are disproportionately large, and/or these individuals would be unlikely to supply or invest in this unique data that make these exceptional contributions unless they are monetarily incentivized. Creators of valuable entertainments, experts in obscure languages who can aid computer translators, specialized masters of video games who can help teach computers to play them expertly in multiplayer settings, these are unique skills worthy of exceptional rewards. On the other hand, tracking every detail of the ordinary use of a Facebook post would be overkill, and certain classes of data should be ‘commoditized’ and paid an ‘average price’ based on meeting basic quality standards.""


Maybe all this seems somewhat far-fetched. But the times we live in today, the things we do, what we see around us, would have seemed utterly incredible even 30 years ago. Google is only 20 years old and it’s already possibly the most powerful company on earth. Facebook was set up in 2004. Things can change very fast.

Leading telecoms companies gather in Barcelona this weekend for their main annual trade fair under the shadow of a bitter clash between the United States and China over network security for the next generation of mobile services.


Accusations from US President Donald Trump's administration that Huawei, the world's biggest network equipment maker, has enabled Chinese state espionage have shaken the industry and raised broader fears for progress in talks to defuse a rumbling trade dispute.

"About 95% of the traffic Sophos tracked appeared to originate in China. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the attackers conducting these brute-force attempts are also located in China, the report clarified, ""because attacks may be routed through other machines under the attackers' control"".


The London honeypot alone suffered 314,000 login attempts over the course of the 30 days in which Sophos ran these honeypots, while the honeypots hosted in Mumbai and Ireland received more than 600,000 login attempts. Does this mean that hosting services in London is safer than hosting services in Mumbai?


No, clarifies the Sophos report, since the brute-force login attempts varied in complexity from default usernames and passwords down to complex passwords with what security practitioners would consider sufficiently complex combinations of numbers, letters, and special characters. Looking at what drives this number of brute force login attempts, for instance, Sophos found the dominant problem was ongoing exposure as a result of not changing default usernames and passwords (eg. root, admin, user, ubuntu and postgres).


Further, many devices ship with default passwords. ""Whether they are easy to guess or not, this is always a mistake,"" cautions the Sophos report. The report advises that users should use complex and unique passwords for each service, and use a password manager too for simplicity."

"When the photos were shown to photographers, they were surprised as they and the subjects in the photos had no idea that those photos were being used for research. In its official statement to the press, IBM said that it used only images that were publicly available, had been used for an earlier research, and users can request them to be removed if they want.


The race to build the most reliable face recognition platform requires a massive data set of faces. Most existing data sets collected for prior research purposes are very limited and lack racial diversity to train facial recognition algorithms. Clearly, companies in the space will require more facial data. Experts are of the opinion that companies that are collecting and working on face data, need to be more transparent on how the data is stored, who all have access to it and how it is going to be used. While Facebook’s photo privacy concern was pinned on an application programming interface (API) bug, the face recognition project by IBM was a case of oversight. However, in both cases, users had no control over their own photos.


There are several cases where photos shared by users on social media or image hosting platforms were stolen, made public to humiliate or blackmail them and misused for fraud and identity theft. Photos from social media can also be used to unlock stolen smartphones where face unlocking mechanism was poorly implemented. Sometimes, photos can reveal more than is visible to users, like location details.


According to researchers from department of Computer Science in Kent State University, when a user shares a photo on social media, the platform captures their GPS coordinates and appends them to the post. Using the API, anyone can retrieve the exact location of the picture via the metadata, while anyone seeing the post could get the location of the user via geospatial tag in the post. A recent McAfee survey involving 1,000 parents found that 30% of the participants were uploading photos of their children daily and 58% of them did it without the child’s consent."
"""Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trampling upon democratic norms in India by running brazenly and blatantly 'NaMo TV'. Isn't the prime minister mocking the Constitution as also every democratic norm?,"" Congress's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala asked.

"Three days ago, communist leader and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan accused the Congress of becoming ""a recruiting agent"" for BJP. ""How can we believe Congress candidates?"" asked Vijayan.

The party is in a disarray over the selection of candidates, with a number of senior leaders turning away from the contest.

New York: Google is still considering whether to launch a censored version of its search engine in China, CEO Sundar Pichai has said, in rare public comments about the controversial and secret project.

To find remnants of nationalism, one has to travel deep inland to the town of Pokhran in the neighbouring Jodhpur constituency. Though the seat is faced with the state’s most high-profile contest—between Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, a future BJP chief ministerial prospect, and Vaibhav Gehlot, the son of the sitting Congress chief minister, many young Hindu men and self-declared “Modi fans"" will only talk about two people who are not in the fray: Modi, obviously, and Saleh Mohammed, the local assembly representative.


In the December assembly election, Mohammed defeated BJP’s Pratap Puri, a Hindu sant, by a thin margin of 900 votes. The assembly seat is 30% Muslim, but in a Hindu-dominated town surrounded by a cluster of Muslim-dominated villages, anxiety runs deep. Nationalism sells like Jio SIM cards, which have begun to flood border regions."

"The so-called black gold is expected to shimmer due to feared supply shortage. Kotak Institutional Equities expects global crude prices to remain elevated amid curtailment of supplies, led by nearly 1 million barrels a day (mn b/d) of reduction in Iran’s crude exports due to the US decision to end sanction waivers on the country. Secondly, partial disruption of about 1.1 mn b/d of Libyan oil production too will weigh on crude prices.


It would be interesting to watch whether Saudi Arabia and the remaining members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) compensate for lack of oil supplies from Iran, added Jain. Already, as the adjacent chart shows, Opec’s crude production has declined in recent months thanks to output cuts.

"Jayalalithaa’s death in 2016 and Karunanidhi’s two years later have introduced a sense of uncertainty in Tamil politics. Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK swept 37 of the state’s 39 Lok Sabha seats in 2014 and in 2016, she became the only leader to come back to power for a second term since 1989, winning 134 of 227 assembly seats.


Now, the party has to win 20 of the 22 assembly seats in the byelections to be contested on Thursday and in May—just to stay in power, amid anti-incumbency, splinter groups, splitting votes and a general resentment of its tie-up with the Bharatiya Janata Party.


There are three splinter groups within the AIADMK who claim the legacy of Jayalalithaa. The EPS-run party got to keep the “two leaves"" symbol for this poll, over claims by a major splinter group led by T.T.V. Dhinakaran, nephew of Sasikala, a former top aide of Jayalalithaa, now in jail."
"Another factor which makes existing global data sets stale is the standard methodology they use. For example, in the Stereographic imagery method, a satellite with two cameras placed at a specified angle is used to take two images of each location at the same time. Looking at the differences between those images helps calculate the height of the elevation at every point. Google is taking a “slightly different"" approach. Instead of using expensive specialized satellite missions, Google first purchased large amounts of standard high resolution optical imagery that is captured anyway, from different sources, and then used them to generate high-resolution elevation.


Google also collaborated with governments for gauge measurements and forecasts so they could tell how much water can be poured into the models and how much can be expected to flow through them. Further, Google wanted a map that ignores anything that water can flow through or under and retain things that would block the waters’ progression. To do this, they used a convolutional neural network (loosely modelled on the brain) that automatically identifies one location or structures that has to be ignored. It can then remove these structures and give an elevation map that the model needs, Nevo said."

"While the Asus ZB556KL seems very similar to the Max M1 Pro on the outside, squint harder and you’ll notice bigger differences. The lower spec screen is 5.45-inches tall and has a resolution of 1440x720, hence having a pixel density of just 247ppi. Contrast and colours are alright, nothing to blow your mind. The touch response is also a bit off, but I’ll give it a pass for a phone at this price. Outdoor visibility is surprisingly good, but it’s marred by the glass, which has a tendency to become scratched quickly.


The Asus Zenfone Max M1 features a 5.45-inch display which has a resolution of 1440x720, hence giving it a pixel density of just 247ppi


Getting to the more exciting part of the phone, powering the device is an aged workhorse—the Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 clocked at 1.4 GHz. It is paired with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage that can be expanded to 256GB.


The phone is quick for most of the time—when you aren’t running background processes. The age of the processor starts showing once you have a few apps open in the background. I noticed a considerable delay when opening the dialer and even searching a contact. Switching between apps is also a bit slow, but hey you have app transitions to entertain you while you’re doing that.


Long answer—you have to keep it on the low graphics setting and still be ready to see a few frame drops every now and then. The load times are on the higher end of the spectrum. You will also notice heat coming off from the back of the phone during gaming sessions."
"As the world gears up to roll out 5G, the next generation of wireless communication networks, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd is facing increased opposition from governments that are worried that its telecom equipment could be used by Chinese intelligence, something the company has always denied.


Australia, New Zealand, and the US have already blocked Huawei from supplying equipment for 5G networks. Britain has decided it can mitigate the risks arising from the use of Huawei equipment in 5G networks, the Financial Times reported on 17 February. Meanwhile, Canada is reviewing whether its gear presents a serious security threat.

The Zenfone Max Pro M2 has received a complete overhaul from the previous boring metal design to a new, flashy glass sandwich design.

"Chinese smartphone Vivo launched the Vivo V15 smartphone in Thailand on Monday. The Vivo V15 is priced at 10,999 Thai Baht (about ?24,500). The Vivo V15 is essentially a stripped down variant of the V15 Pro, which went on sale yesterday in India at ?28,990.


The Vivo V15 sports the same pop-up camera mechanism, display and design as the V15 Pro but lacks a few key features. The V15 skips the 48MP primary rear camera and goes for the traditional rear-facing fingerprint sensor instead of an in-display sensor found inside the V15 Pro. The V15 runs MediaTek's Helio P70 processor while the V15 Pro runs Qualcomm's Snapdragon 675 SoC.


The Vivo V15 and V15 Pro offer the same design—a notch-less display at the front, a glossy back with dual tone gradient in the same colours. A centrally black strip holds the rear-facing camera module together, giving the smartphones a rather unique look. The back of the V15 Pro is clean otherwise while V15's back panel is interrupted by a fingerprint sensor."

"Glackin insists that monsoon forecasts are important for Indian agriculture, especially as climate changes because farmers no longer can rely on just traditional knowledge.


But what exactly is this ‘Decision Platform’? Data is the first part of the platform, explains Glackin. It comprises weather data collected from remote sensing and satellite imagery and drones that are being used in some parts of the world.


The second big part is collating localized weather data, which could also be historical. This data helps IBM build an electronic field record to understand the historical context and current scenario. “If you are a lender, you may want to know the past record in that field or plot—risk of the particular farmer—what was grown there, for instance,"" explains Glackin. The third part is extracting insights from that data, which is where machine learning and AI are used.


The last piece is around “Decision Support""—exploring choices and making decisions. It’s here that AI (machine learning) helps in making decisions. “This is what we do in the weather world—we take forecasts from multiple sources and do machine learning on that to move it forward,"" says Glackin."
"HYDERABAD: Hyderabad: In just about a year’s time, the political landscape of Andhra Pradesh has changed completely, with the narrative now revolving around the demand of special category status for the state. The alliances between parties are also in complete reversal, with the ruling Telugu Desam Party (TDP) now facing a serious threat from the main opposition YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), and finding itself without an alliance partner before the forthcoming assembly and Lok Sabha elections.


In 2014, the TDP, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and actor-turned-politician Pawan Kalyan’s Jana Sena party (JSP) had joined hands to take on the Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy-led YSRCP. This time, the electoral battle is likely to be a multi-cornered fight, with the TDP exiting the NDA in March last year, over alleged lack of enough central funding and demand for special status, and Kalyan withdrawing support to the TDP in 2018.


The JSP leader even surprised everyone by lashing out against TDP supremo and Andhra Pradesh chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and his son and IT minister N. Lokesh, alleging that they were corrupt. Earlier this year, Kalyan had announced that he will contest the polls in alliance with Left parties. So far, the BJP, YSRCP, TDP and Congress have not announced any pre-poll alliance, like was the case in 2014."

"Moreover, distributors are beginning to consider other brands as options too, though none of those who spoke with Mint mentioned Indian brands, specifically, as being under their consideration.


But the unintended side-effect of the disruption unleashed by Jio, which caused the temporary downfall of the feature phone, has been the massive expansion in the market itself. Many of the first-time mobile internet users may get on board via the feature phone—the erstwhile forte of the likes of Micromax and Lava.


Feature phone is also a segment where Indian brands never really lost their presence completely. In fact, in December 2017, Micromax claimed it had sold three million handsets under its Bharat range of cheap smartphones.


The launch of the Jiophone2 and Airtel’s nascent plans to launch its own low-cost device means telcos may be on the look-out for a number of tie-ups with phone makers.


Micromax’s Jain dreams of a future where the ideal smartphone strategy is not just new product launches, but tying up with telcos, so that consumers buy a phone and get 4G plans bundled with it.


“There’s a general belief in Tier III and Tier IV towns that if you’re using a smartphone, your data gets consumed automatically,"" said Jain. He thinks this is why the Jiophone was a subsidised feature phone, instead of a subsidised smartphone. “Slowly and steadily, consumers started consuming data... And even 1GB becomes too less for an entire month,"" he added.


IDC’s Navkendar Singh agrees that Micromax and Lava “still have juice left"", though he also mentioned that Intex has “almost moved out"" of the market. “They’ll have to pick and choose their battles. Don’t fight Xiaomi in the ? 7,000- ? 10,000 range,"" said Singh. He suggested that the right government and telco tie-ups could help.


Micromax recently won a ? 15,00-crore deal from the Chattisgarh government to distribute 50 lakh smartphones —part of an emerging trend in politics where free phones are dangled to win over youth support.


But merely relying on such populist sops, or possible tie-ups with telcos, isn’t much of a strategy. Unless Indian phone makers can quickly figure out a way to go down the “relatively cheap premium route""—a segment OnePlus completely dominates— their hopes of a dramatic return to the dominance of 2014 may be dangling by a very tenuous thread.

"Even as advancements in technology such as brain-computer interfaces and sensor-lined caps with neural interface software could soon be used by brain researchers to control computers, robotic prosthetic limbs, motorized wheelchairs and even digital avatars, cyberattackers may be able to exploit memory implants to steal, spy on, alter or control human memories. And while the most radical threats are several decades away, the essential technology already exists in the form of implantable deep brain stimulation devices, according to a 1 November report by researchers from Kaspersky Lab and the University of Oxford Functional Neurosurgery Group.


As scientists learn how memories are created in the brain and can be targeted, restored and enhanced using such implantable devices, they simultaneously caution that vulnerabilities exist in the connected software and hardware and “these need to be addressed if we are to be ready for the threats that lie ahead"".


Known as implantable pulse generators or neurostimulators, these contraptions send electrical impulses to specific targets in the brain to treat disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, major depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

"A part of the increase was also due to the Election Commission's efforts at cleaning up voter rolls to eliminate non-existent voters, but widespread voter anger also helped. The post-Emergency 1977 elections had also witnessed a huge turnout.


(2) Women voters: Female turnout spiked in 2014 to its highest levels ever and almost matched the male voter turnout.


(3) Faceoff: The 2014 hustings was a first for both the national parties as far as vote share was concerned: the BJP's vote share crossed 30% while that of Congress fell below 20%.


In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, amid its best-ever performance, the BJP won 26 Lok Sabha seats for the first time ever. These include eight seats in Uttar Pradesh and seven seats in Bihar. It also broke new ground beyond the Hindi heartland, notably with three seats in Telangana and two seats in Andhra Pradesh."
"In fact, the survey more specifically points out: “In the first place, there has been no statistical evidence of any increase in economic “bads"" such as consumption of alcohol and tobacco. On the contrary, in Bhil tribal village, there was actually a drop in consumption of alcohol since that is where people had liquidity to use for agricultural inputs and therefore one saw an increase in agricultural productivity and own cultivation effect.""


Interestingly, evidence from Africa, is also along similar lines. As Rutger Bregman writes in Utopia for Realists: “The great thing about money is that people can use it to buy things they need instead of things that self-appointed experts think they need. And, as it happens, there is one category of product which poor people do not spend their free money on, and that’s alcohol and tobacco. In fact, a major study by the World Bank demonstrated that in 82% of all researched cases in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, alcohol and tobacco consumption actually declined.""


The Congress plans to tackle this problem by making the payment to women. In fact, former finance minister P. Chidambaram has said: “We will insist that every family should open an account in the name of the woman in the family and the money will be transferred to her account.""


The logic here is that free money from the government will make people lazy and this will lead to them dropping out of the labour force. Let’s look at this in the context of NYAY. An amount of ?6,000 per month per household has been promised. An average Indian household has five individuals. So, this works out to ?1,200 per month per individual, on an average. People who feel that individuals will opt out of the workforce because the unit members are earning ?1,200 per month extra, have a very low opinion of the ambitions of Indians. Also, if they stop working, their situation may continue to be the same as it was earlier, and the entire benefit of the extra money will be nullified. This concern largely comes from the wrong belief of the rich and the middle class that the poor are poor because they are lazy.


There is evidence from different parts of the world which doesn’t suggest anything like this. As an August 2018 research paper titled Universal Basic Income: An Effective Policy for Poverty Reduction? published by the Centre for Social Justice, points out: “The extent to which UBI disincentives work is dependent on its generosity. The Alaska Permanent Fund pays out $2,000 annually, and analysis has shown that it has little to no effect on the supply of labour."" By that logic ?1,200 per individual per month is not high at all.


In fact, the Canadian Mincome experiment carried out in the 1970s, had some very interesting evidence to offer on this front. As Standing points out: “In the Canadian Mincome experiment, ‘mothers with newborns stopped working because they wanted to stay at home longer with their babies, and teenagers worked less because they weren’t under much pressure to support their families, which resulted in more teenagers graduating’."" This is the kind of withdrawal from the labour force, which is good in the long term.


In fact, this is the most genuine concern. NYAY is expected to cost ?3.6 trillion or around 1.7% of the forecasted gross domestic product (GDP) for 2019-20. As Chidambaram has said: “Our calculation shows that it will not cross 2% of the GDP, it will be 1.8% of the GDP at any given point of time."" This is a lot of money, something which can easily derail the scheme as well as government finances.

Realme’s current line-up consists of the Realme 2, Realme 2 Pro and Realme C1—all of which may become expensive in the coming days. The Realme 2 is currently priced at ? 8,990 while the Realme 2 Pro and C1 are priced at ? 13,990 and ? 6,999, respectively.


Realme is not the only company to hike prices of smartphones, though. Xiaomi, during the consolidated launch of the Redmi 6-series, mentioned that prices of the phones were “introductory"" and would be changed after Diwali."
"How reliable are foldable screens? Most of these foldable phones have more plastic substrates, which is what makes them bendable. Technically, plastic substrates are less prone to damage than glass, but can bend up to only a certain point. Royole Corp. claims that the organic light-emitting diode panel used in FlexPai has been tested to withstand bending over 200,000 times. Chinese display maker BOE  has developed a 7.56-inch foldable display that can bend more than 100,000 times. Experts feel bendable screens will have shorter life cycle than existing phones. “While technological advances, such as the polymer of the flexible displays are more durable, it would eventually wear out from a lot of folding and unfolding. This, in turn, could lead to a natural replacement cycle, cutting shorter the long upgrade cycles that the market is witnessing currently,"" explains Prabhu Ram, head (Industry Intelligence Group) at CyberMedia Research. 


How soon will we see them?: While FlexPai will start shipping from next month, Samsung is expected to roll out its foldable smartphone sometime during the first half of 2019 and ship at least one million units. Like most new technologies, foldable screens will be available at a premium. “Display is a major component in a smartphone, which accounts for 20-30% of the Bill of Materials cost in a premium smartphone. Therefore, higher display prices will directly affect the cost of the smartphone. The initial adoption will be limited to few models in the premium smartphone segment in 2019 and price diffusion to lower price tier will take substantially more time than any of the other recent new features,"" says Pavel Naiya, senior analyst (Devices and Ecosystem) at research firm Counterpoint.


Challenges:  The technology is still in its early stages. Manufacturers will have to tweak their interface, developers will have to customize their apps for the new form factor and aspect ratio, and display makers will have to find ways to enhance the life of the panel. Existing displays will not die away as there will always be buyers looking for a smaller screen. Smartphones with large foldable screens will be relevant for users looking for that extra bit of legroom for work and fun."

"On one end there is Mumbai, India’s densest city with 19,652 people per sq. km (20,980 in suburban Mumbai as per the 2011 census) and on the other, there is Nandurbar, 360km away, with a population density of 277. Nearly 70% of Nandurbar’s population is tribal, making it the third district in the state with the highest share of scheduled tribes (ST).


Maharashtra’s Economic Survey 2017-18 says that in 2016-17, Mumbai added a gross value of ?3.85 trillion at current prices. Meanwhile, Nandurbar and the neighbouring district of Dhule generated gross value of only ?13,580 crore and ?24,885 crore, respectively. Mumbai’s Human Development Index (2011 census) was 0.841, the highest in the state, and Nandurbar with 0.604 HDI is at the bottom of the pile. Even Nashik, which goes to polls on 29 April, has HDI of 0.746, which is in the highest category.


Given such diversity, voters’ expectations and priorities will differ as well. In Shirur near Pune, for instance, software engineer Abhjit Kadam, 28, says the farm crisis has driven many farmers to desperation and the youth from farming families do not want to continue working in the fields. “Thanks to the mushrooming of private engineering colleges, they have engineering degrees, but there are very few jobs available here, though a large part of the constituency has industrial estates,"" Kadam says.


In Navi Mumbai, which is part of the Thane constituency, civil engineer Dhiraj Upadhyay lists out his priorities that could resonate with a large section of the urban middle-class. “It is about governance, ease of doing business, change in laws and system as per the changing times, transparency, India’s standing in the international market, and, finally, how efficiently my hard-earned money paid through taxes is spent,"" Upadhayay says."

"In the Telangana assembly polls last year (which were scheduled to be held along with the Lok Sabha elections, but were advanced), the BJP could retain only one of the five seats it had won in 2014. It clearly showed that it did not have much strength on its own. The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) led by chief minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao swept the polls by winning 88 of the 119 seats.


“Former state minister D.K. Aruna just joined us yesterday and we are planning to get some more Congress leaders into our fold, who will contest the upcoming elections.

"Ahead of the general elections due in April-May this year, the interim budget for 2019-20 had a strong focus on the rural and agricultural sector, sops for the middle class and workers, along with a broader social push. However, there was a marginal slippage in the 2018-19 and 2019-20 fiscal deficit targets, resulting in a sharp increase in the borrowing quantum.


The government missed its 2018-19 fiscal deficit target of 3.3% of GDP and instead pegged it at 3.4%. It also budgeted the 2019-20 fiscal deficit target at 3.4% of GDP, missing the glide path target of 3.1%.


“Overall, the government presented an expansionary budget and prioritised populism over fiscal prudence. The deviation from the 2018-19 fiscal deficit target and the 'pause' on 2019-20 fiscal consolidation is a negative surprise, relative to our expectations,"" said Nomura in a note on 1 February.

In an encouraging voter participation trend, female voter turnout in both the first two phases of Lok Sabha elections over the last fortnight has been marginally more than male voters.

At first glance, it looks like tower infrastructure services provider Bharti Infratel Ltd exited FY19 on a rather steady note. It reported a 1% rise in consolidated revenues. The brutal competition in the sector notwithstanding, operating profit dropped just 6% and net profit was flat for the full year ended March 2019.

"An EUV mask, a sandwich of about 80 alternating layers of silicon and molybdenum, can fetch as much as $100,000. Only two companies – glassmakers Hoya Corp. and AGC Inc., both in Japan – manufacture the blanks. Lasertec’s machines can spot problems early on, which is critical to making the technology cost competitive. “For EUV, masks have to be perfect,"" Okabayashi said.


EUV lithography is so complex and expensive that so far only Samsung and TSMC have said they will use it to move to 7-nanometer chipmaking. Intel Corp. has delayed its introduction, while difficulties in making EUV economically viable have prompted Globalfoundries Inc. to reportedly abandon it altogether.


Samsung has said that the move lets it use chip area 40 percent more efficiently, improves performance by 20 percent and halves power consumption. Apple’s 7-nanometer processor is manufactured by TSMC and is specialized for machine-learning applications. In the past few months, Qualcomm Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co. unveiled a 7-nanometer chip that will power 5G devices.


“It used to be that chip demand was completely dependent on product cycles for personal computers,"" Okabayashi said. “But then came smartphones and pretty soon we’ll be able to add AI, IOT and 5G to the list of applications driving demand."""

"New users: For users planning to buy a new Kindle, the choice is between an entry-level All-New Kindle, the All-New Kindle Paperwhite and the top-of-the-line Kindle Oasis. All the models use a touch-enabled e-ink display with thin glass on top. Unlike LCD displays, which require consistent power supply to show content on screen, e-ink displays need power only when a user has to flip pages. That makes them battery efficient, allowing Kindles to last several days (around 2 weeks) on each charge.


However, size of the e-ink displays varies based on models, as do their resolution. For instance, the most affordable —the All-New Kindle ( ? 5,999)—has a 6-inch e-ink display, which relies entirely on ambient light to show text on the screen. So, you can’t use it in a dark room. However, a small, low-wattage light bulb is all you need to use the entry-level Kindle effectively. You can even use a book light, which can be clipped on top of the Kindle and costs under ? 1,000. Moreover, the absence of a backlight means there will be no strain on your eyes when reading, making the entry-level Kindle the digital equivalent of a real book. It offers 4GB of internal storage, which is enough to house over 1,000 books."

That’s helped the Tokyo-based company ship twice as many PS4s as Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox One, even without relying on its usual tempo of price cuts.


That puts Sony’s franchise in a strong position to counter the $34.6 billion console industry’s next challenge: games delivered via the web.

It’s important to note that those three companies are the largest non-Chinese names, and get only a minority of revenue from China. So if they’re hurting, then the whole world is probably hurting, too.


If there’s a silver lining to the recent slowdown in shipments it’s that the higher functionality requires more expensive components, which boosted gross margins at some suppliers. But margins only help when people are still buying those cooler, hipper, more-expensive devices.


That silver lining is also likely to darken this year because smartphone makers seem to be running out of of ideas.

""No new policies to increase revenues were announced, while a number of expenditure measures were announced that will increase outlays and put pressure on the government’s ability to meet its fiscal deficit target"", said Moody's Investors Service in a note. ""Ongoing slippage from the government’s budgeted fiscal deficit targets over the past two years, and our expectation that the government will face challenges meeting its target again this coming fiscal year (ending March 2020) does not bode well for medium term fiscal consolidation. We view this continued slippage as credit negative for the sovereign"", Moody's Investors added."

Zuckerberg said Facebook would welcome common standards for verifying political actors, citing practices deployed by advertisers in many countries of verifying identities before buying political ads. He also suggested updating laws to include 'divisive political issues' in addition to candidates and elections.


“Every day we make decisions about what speech is harmful, what constitutes political advertising, and how to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks,"" he said. “But if we were starting from scratch, we wouldn’t ask companies to make these judgments alone.""

India's ban on popular Chinese video app TikTok is resulting in ""financial losses"" of up to $500,000 a day for its developer, Beijing Bytedance Technology Co, and has put more than 250 jobs at risk, the company said in a court filing seen by Reuters.


TikTok allows users to create and share short videos with special effects and is one of the world's most popular apps. It has been downloaded by nearly 300 million users so far in India, out of more than 1 billion downloads globally, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower.


Earlier this month, an Indian state court ordered the federal government to prohibit its downloads, saying the app was encouraging pornography. Acting upon instructions from the federal IT ministry, Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google last week removed TikTok from their India app stores."

The button presses were precise initially, but after a couple of months, I have started noticing a few misses, especially while dragging things. The DPI modes range from 800 DPI to 2400DPI. This makes the mouse suitable for semi-professional gaming at best. It’s not extremely precise while gaming, but browsing through the internet is a breeze with this, especially because of the forward and backward buttons on the left. Also, every DPI mode has its own LED colour.

But one former Facebook privacy manager, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed unease about users' posts being scrutinized without their explicit permission. The European Union's year-old General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has strict rules about how companies gather and use personal data and in many cases requires specific consent.

If the purpose is looking at posts to improve the precision of services, that should be stated explicitly, Kennedy said. Using an outside vendor for the work could also require consent, he said.


It remains unclear exactly how GDPR will be interpreted and whether regulators and consumers would see Facebook's internal labeling practices as problematic. Europe's top data privacy official declined to comment on possible concerns.

New Delhi: This year, we saw some technologies mature while others became better understood. What was once a buzzword is now close to mainstream. And what was once a dream, is now closer to reality. We highlight 10 technologies, which we at Mint believe, will make a significant impact in 2019.


AI is creeping into almost every aspect of our lives. It’s in our smartphones, our cars, our email inboxes and in our smart homes. From companies implementing AI-powered human resource (HR) technologies to AI managing logistics and operations, and even helping click better photos on your phone, AI is everywhere—in the form of machine learning (ML), deep learning (an ML technique), computer vision or natural language processing (NLP). AI will accompany every other disruptive tech we speak of such as detecting facial and human emotions, and recognising people from their gaits. It will also be used to predict how humans will react to ads, movie trailers and more.


Blockchain is not just about powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether. A distributed digital ledger format, it is also being used by manufacturing companies to improve their supply chains; by healthcare and electricity companies; and by the financial sector to make transactions more transparent.


For instance, NITI Aayog and Oracle plan to start a drug supply-chain blockchain ledger, which is meant to help fight counterfeit drugs in the country. The Telangana State Information Technology, Electronics and Communication department has tied up with IT services provider Tech Mahindra to launch India’s first Blockchain district in Telangana. However, most pilots are being done with private (permissioned) blockchains that can perform thousands of transactions per second. In India, for instance, banks have formed ‘BankChain’—an alliance of banks formed in February 2017 to explore and build blockchain-based solutions."

"Ram Prasad Yadav (left) and Hanuman Prasad Yadav are small farmers from Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh. They strongly feel that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will return to power as he saved cows from slaughter and the country from terrorism. (Sayantan Bera/Mint)


Farmers in central Uttar Pradesh appear happy with the PM-Kisan scheme and are singing a nationalist tune


Lucknow/Amethi/Agra: The face of Sri Ram, a marginal farmer who doubles up as a village barber, sinks as he shows his bank passbook. The Sunday when Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a direct cash transfer scheme for farmers in Uttar Pradesh’s Gorakhpur, about two weeks before the dates of general elections were announced on 10 March, Sri Ram’s account was credited with ?2,000, a sizeable sum for someone who struggles to make ?50 on an average day.


The credit was reversed the same day, Ram found out later from the bank but he wasn’t told why. The disappointment on Ram’s face shows that small sums of money do make a difference when incomes fluctuate from one day to the next. Under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme (PM-KISAN) announced in the interim budget in February, small and marginal farm households owning less than five acres of land are eligible for a direct cash assistance of ?6,000 every year, credited to bank accounts in three instalments.


“For a farmer struggling to make ends meet any support is better than nothing, but the timing of the scheme which was launched just before the elections revealed the government’s true intentions,"" said Rakesh Singh, also a farmer, standing next to Ram. PM-KISAN is similar to how politicians bribe voters on the eve of elections, complained Singh, adding, the handout will not even cover the irrigation costs for growing an acre of wheat crop.


This discussion is taking place on the sidelines of a public hearing organized by a social worker in Jais-Bahadurpur in Uttar Pradesh’s Amethi. Among the motley crowd are a group of scheduled caste women who are yet to receive the money. They too are disappointed but are more worried that their names are missing from the subsidized food distribution scheme.


Some distance away from the public hearing, residents of Amethi’s Pure Dhana Pandey village, who are mostly farmers and daily wagers, defended Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s new scheme for farmers, after a host of other schemes, from soil health card to crop insurance, failed to make a mark. “Cash deposits are better than spending money on schemes… we have to bribe local officials to benefit from government schemes. Even bank officials take commissions for advancing (subsidized) farm loans,"" said Rajesh Kumar, a potato grower."

An added benefit for the research team is that the Bible is already thoroughly indexed by the consistent use of book, chapter and verse numbers. The predictable organization of the text across versions eliminates the risk of errors that could be caused by automatic methods of matching different versions of the same text.

Now the investment company says it’s ready to capitalize on an end of the economic cycle as indicators warn that a recession is imminent in the coming quarters.


The consensus is pointing to a recession in 2020 or 2021, Tavi Costa, a global macro analyst at Crescat, said by phone. “We think it’s a lot closer than that and we have a number of macro timing indicators that we look at.""

Among the warning signs, Crescat cites corporate insiders who are currently selling stocks hand over fist—indicating a potential stock bubble burst. In early 2017, those investors heavily sold shares while the S&P 500 continued climbing. That happened again in 2018.

ByteDance’s wildly popular news and entertainment portal, Jinri Toutiao (translated as “Today’s Headlines,"") relies heavily on AI — not human editors, or a self-selected feed of accounts — to curate and create customized streams of largely user-and-partner-generated content tailored to each of its readers.


These are services where a sort of “filter"" bubble — isolating users into worlds of points of view — isn’t an unintended consequence. It’s the point. And it’s extremely effective: Both Toutiao and Douyin have drawn attention from Chinese regulators for, among many other things, some familiar to any large social-ish platform, and others unique to its speech-constrained political environment, capturing too much user time. As a result, TikTok’s “Digital Wellbeing"" settings include an option to enforce a password-protected time limit. The company’s other challenges can be addressed more assertively: an algorithm-first attention market isn’t just centrally ruled, it’s centrally allocated.


All of this goes a long way to explain why, at least at first, TikTok can seem disorienting. “You’re not actually sure why you’re seeing what you’re seeing,"" said Ankur Thakkar, the former editorial lead at Vine, TikTok’s other most direct forerunner. On Vine, a new user might not have had much to watch, or felt much of a reason to create anything, but they understood their context: the list of people they followed, which was probably the thing letting them down.


“It’s doing the thing that Twitter tried to solve, that everyone tried to solve,"" he said. “How do you get people to engage?"" Apparently you just ... show them things, and let a powerful artificial intelligence take notes. You start sending daily notifications immediately. You tell them what to do. You fake it till you make it, algorithmically speaking.


U.S. social platforms, each fighting their own desperate and often stock-price-related fights to increase user engagement, have trended in TikTok’s general direction for a while. It is possible, today, to receive highly personalized and effectively infinite content recommendations in YouTube without ever following a single account, because Google watches what you do, and makes guesses about who you are. And while Facebook and Twitter don’t talk about their products this way, we understand that sometimes — maybe a lot of the time — we use them just to fill time. They, in turn, want as much of our time as possible, and are quite obviously doing whatever they can to get it.


So maybe you’ll sit TikTok out. But these things have a way of sneaking up behind you. Maybe you never joined Snapchat — but its rise worried Facebook so much that its prettier product, Instagram, was remade in its image, and copied concepts from Snapchat reached you there.


And maybe you skipped Twitter — but it still rewired your entire news diet, and, besides, it’s how the president talks to you, now.


TikTok does away with many of the assumptions other social platforms have been built upon, and which they are in the process of discarding anyway. It questions the primacy of individual connections and friend networks. It unapologetically embraces central control rather than pretending it doesn’t have it. TikTok’s real influence going forward may be that the other social media platforms decide that our friends were simply holding us back. Or, at least, it was holding them back."

"The government in Beijing on Tuesday used its report to the annual National People’s Congress to lower its growth goal for the year to a target of 6% to 6.5% and pledged to keep the yuan basically stable at reasonable equilibrium levels, while also allowing greater flexibility.


That suits China’s own interests, given the risk of capital outflows and market instability that would be triggered by a currency slump. Yet it’s less clear how much sovereignty over the yuan China will want to cede in any trade agreement with the US.


""It looks unrealistic to us that China would accept any explicit clause putting down ranges for the dollar-yuan rate or incorporating a vigorous monitoring process,"" wrote Frances Cheung, head of Asia macrostrategy at Westpac Banking Corp., in a note Tuesday. ""A rigid exchange-rate policy would have wide implications on China’s multi-year reform on the foreign-exchange system and the opening-up of capital markets.""


China’s yuan surged 2.6% against the dollar this year, making it the best performing currency in Asia, and has rallied to the highest level since July versus a basket of exchange rates. That’s a far cry from 2018, when the yuan tumbled more than 5% amid concerns over the US-China trade war and monetary easing by the central bank."

"Xiaomi’s scanner has the dimensions of 25mm x 50.2mm, which is reasonably bigger than most other thumbprint sized in-display sensors. Photo: Lin Bin/Weibo


In-display fingerprint scanners are one of the most worked upon features of the smartphone industry. Chinese smartphone company Vivo pioneered the technology that allows people to unlock their smartphones simply by touching their displays. Other players, like Oppo, OnePlus and Huawei quickly caught on to include the technology in their smartphones.


The technology relies on an optical fingerprint sensor, which uses a light source to capture a high-resolution photograph of your fingerprints and uses algorithms to identify unique patterns. To capture a high-resolution image, it requires a light source, which has to be strong enough to illuminate your fingerprint. The problem arises when the light has to hit the sensor after bouncing back from your finger. As a result, this tech can work only with OLED displays, since an LCD’s backlight can get in the way."

"The story suggested that Sandberg and Zuckerberg weren’t as involved with the serious issues facing the company as they should have been. Rather the two top executives were more concerned about continuing to defend Facebook’s reputation and embarked on an aggressive lobbying campaign to fend off critics.


The report has once again prompted the ire of lawmakers, who summoned Zuckerberg earlier this year for two days of Congressional hearings regarding the Russian affair and data privacy.


Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who has sought to increase transparency of online political ads, said Thursday that she would write to Facebook and the Justice Department to ask whether any elected officials were targeted in the opposition research. She said it could be a campaign finance issue.


In 2017, Klobuchar proposed legislation to compel Facebook and others to disclose who bought political ads on their sites. The Times said that after a call from Sandberg at the time, Klobuchar dialed back criticism of Facebook, although her office stressed she didn’t change the bill in response to the outreach.

"The PM-Kisan cash transfer scheme launched on 24 February aims to benefit over 120 million farm households across India, and is being rolled out at a breakneck speed to ensure that farmers receive the first instalment before they cast their votes in the Lok Sabha elections starting 11 April. The scheme is expected to cost ?20,000 crore in 2018-19 and ?75,000 crore in 2019-20.


“In Uttar Pradesh up to 20 million farmers could benefit…and so far about 10.4 million farmers have received the money,"" said Soraj Singh, director of agriculture in the state. “If we convert the in-kind allocations for farmers under state schemes they get ?2 per day per family, with PM-Kisan they are getting ?17 per day in cash… bank accounts with tiny amounts like ?200-300 are being credited by ?2,000 in a go,"" said Singh, defending the scheme against criticism that the assistance is paltry.


Major farmer organizations have criticized the scheme calling it a “bribe"" ahead of elections while politicians like Congress president Rahul Gandhi termed it an “insult"" to farmers. Experts and economists too said cash transfers may curtail future public investments in agriculture, like in irrigation or research.


However, the majority of farmers in Uttar Pradesh’s Agra, Amethi, Kannauj and Barabanki districts, where Mint travelled last week, perceive the scheme differently, although on ground only a handful of families said they have received the money. Mint chose to travel to these districts in central Uttar Pradesh, which are dominated by small land holding farmers, to understand the economic and electoral impact of PM-Kisan, unlike western parts of the state where farmers owe their relative prosperity to sugarcane cultivation.


Take for instance the opinion of Ram Prasad Yadav, a small farmer from Barabanki: “Is ?6,000 nothing? At least we can buy salt and chilies, spend on school books and shoes, buy some clothes… farmers may not vote for Modi for this money but there are other reasons to vote for him.""


This “other"" reason, an apparent surge of nationalism, has seemingly possessed the rural voter in these parts, be it a young college student about to enter the job market, or a farmer staying awake the entire night to guard his crop from stray cattle. “This election is not about the kisan, it is about the nation,"" said 30-year-old Radheshyam Nishad from Agra, when asked how the state government and the centre have helped farmers to get better crop prices or manage recurrent weather risks. What about the stray cattle menace created by a ban on slaughter and risks in transportation of unproductive cattle? “We cannot expect the Prime Minister to come and guard our crop.""


The majority of farmers Mint spoke to contend that compensation for crop loss or the state-initiated loan waiver did not reach them due to corrupt bank or local government officials. The stray cattle menace is one of their own making, since it is they who have abandoned cows. The farmers and daily wagers in these villages admit that the federal government has largely ignored their plight but the dissatisfaction which was palpable a few months ago has been replaced by admiration and a sense of pride. More importantly, they are unwilling to blame the Prime Minister for their troubles."
"At the same time, its allies the trade unions too are struggling as the juggernaut of liberalization changes the country’s industrial structure.

“A change in the content, composition, and character of the workers has to be taken into account by the Left. Its slogans have to be reversed from this point of understanding,"" said Viswam. “The Left has to redefine itself, notwithstanding its past and songs of struggles. Its basic commitment to the poor should stand uncompromised.""


The Left is more than just the organized Left. Many political parties that are secular—from Janata Dal (Secular), popular in Kolar, to Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar, to Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu—have been influenced by the Left, although what they are actually practising now is another story.


There have always been enough people who do not feel very strongly about Left ideology. But there are also a lot of people who may have feelings similar to those embodied by Left ideology, but vote for other parties. The Left, in both cases, lose out electorally."

Aside from its steep price tag, problems with the devices include poor readability in sunlight, and a bulky design needed to protect the screen's fold, according to the research firm.


Analysts have also expressed concerns over the durability of the devices since folds are typically areas where problems are most likely to develop in electronic devices over time.


""Generally the trend has been to have a design that does not have any mechanical elements in a smartphone to make them more durable,"" said Ian Fogg, a senior mobile industry analyst at OpenSignal, which collects and analyses data from mobile networks."

"Not everyone agrees that Rae Bareli has been developed. A section of voters would like a change, but say that they do not have strong alternatives to pick from. In this election, Sonia Gandhi’s main opposition is from Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) Dinesh Pratap Singh. Singh is a former Congress leader and a former member of the legislative council. He has been in the BJP for a little over a year.


In previous elections, too, no party—neither the BJP nor the Bahujan Samaj Party—had fielded a ‘heavyweight’ who could put up a tough fight.


“Every constituency demands change. We would want to see how someone else works. We feel Prime Minister Narendra Modi is doing a good job in the centre, but here, their contender is a former Congressman—how is that an option for us to consider?

The road ahead for BJP will be challenging as the party had won 282 seats in the 2014 polls, but its present strength in the Lok Sabha is 268, after losing 14 bypolls in the last five years.


A key loss was the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat, which was represented by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath. In Phulpur, BJP lost the by-election for the seat vacated by deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya. It also lost in Kairana.

"“It takes the pressure off me,"" said Erin Kraftchick, who typically keeps the cards in her wallet and hands them out when it’s time to make a purchase.


The Kraftchicks are part of a growing group of busy parents who are trying out app-controlled debit cards to give their offspring allowance, manage chores and teach them about money. Despite talk of a cashless society, physical cash is still widely preferred for small purchases, according to the Federal Reserve. But children may lose cash, or parents may not have it on hand when it’s time to pay up.


“We got tired of having a drawer full of dollars,"" said Brandi Tzonev, a sales manager and personal trainer in Lawrenceville, Georgia, who uses goHenry with her 15-year-old son, Alex, and 10-year-old daughter, Gabriella.


Some banks have long had accounts aimed at children and teenagers, and many families use prepaid debit cards — rather than traditional debit cards, linked to a checking account — as a way to help children manage money. But the newest generation of “smart"" debit cards are managed by advanced mobile apps that give parents detailed control over how much the young people spend — and even where they spend — with a few taps on a phone.


In addition to goHenry, which has been available in Britain for five years and moved into the United States this spring, the cards include financial technology startups like Greenlight, backed by Amazon and others, and Current, financed in part by an arm of Fifth Third Bank.


Details vary slightly by card, but in general a parent establishes an account or “wallet,"" linked to their traditional checking account. The app draws money from the bank account, and the parent transfers funds electronically to the child’s card. The child can spend only what is available on the card. Parents can set spending limits and restrict where cards can be used."

Samsung has also put a punch hole on the top right, to accommodate the front cameras, which gives it a more unique look than the notch designs other companies have used. Whether you like this, will depend on your personal preference. The display on the Galaxy S10 Plus isn’t a big upgrade to last year’s S9 but it definitely ranks among the best you can get today."

a Tony (Downey Jr) gets to settle his father issues, Captain America aka Steve (Evans) to have a shot at a normal life, Thor to choose between being god and man, Hulk aka Bruce to make peace with both his brain and brawn (though Ruffalo is Ruffalo, and sorely missed in his new green mass), Hawkeye aka Barton (Renner) acknowledges his feelings for Black Widow aka Natasha (Johansson), while the latter learns about her dad and has one of the most profound moments in the film, while just eating a sandwich


Starting with Downey Jr and Evans, the actors put their heart and soul into the goings-on, even when the film gets incredulous over its 3-hour-plus length and sags, like in Infinity War, in the real bang-for-the-buck bits


 However, the clear winner hands down is Hemsworth as Thor, now with straggly hair and a paunch, who has let himself go in the years following Thanos’s destruction of the world, wallowing in self-pity and beer"
"Pawar’s nephew Ajit hasn’t been able to step out of the Maval constituency where his son Parth is up against Shiv Sena’s Shrirang Barne to campaign for other NCP nominees.


As 14 Maharashtra seats go to polls on Tuesday, the NCP, founded two decades ago by Pawar, is fighting a battle for survival against a rampaging BJP-Shiv Sena-Republican Party of India alliance.


In 2014, the NCP won only four Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra. One of its four members of Parliament (MPs) Vijaysinh Mohite-Patil shared the stage with Modi at a BJP rally last week in Akluj while Patil’s son Ranjeetsinh has already joined the BJP. In Dindori near Nashik, the BJP has poached Bharati Pawar from the NCP and fielded her.


“The Congress-NCP alliance invested lot of efforts in industrialization of Maharashtra which helped them build ties with the top echelons of the corporate world. But this connection has been disrupted by the new corporate class and a neo-intellectual class of voters which finds traction with the BJP. NCP has been put into a deep dilemma due to these socio-economic changes,"" said Prakash Pawar, professor of political science at the Shivaji University, Kolhapur."
"Sophisticated machine learning—considered a subset of artificial intelligence—and deep learning (a machine learning technique) algorithms are being trained on humongous amounts of data to draw inferences and patterns that can help firms make better business decisions. The increase in computing power is only helping artificial intelligence do this task, faster and almost in real-time. Artificial intelligence is already in your smartphones in the form of voice assistants, smarter cameras that can auto correct the focus and sharpen pictures, intelligent email inbox, etc.


Artificial intelligence is also doing image recognition, speech recognition, besides powering self-driving cars and powering smart home automation devices. Yet, there are concerns since unsupervised deep learning neural networks (loosely modelled on the human brain) are still largely unexplained black boxes. This has given rise to the concept of ‘Explainable AI’, pressuring the neural networks to explain how they arrived at a decision just as we humans do.


Blockchain, the technology that powers cryptocurrencies, is another tool that holds a lot of promise in terms of reducing costs, building efficiencies and establishing trust. But there are challenges like slower speeds (4,000 or so) of processing transactions (compared to say a master card or visa card that does almost 40,000).


Besides, most pilots across the world are being done with private (permissioned) blockchains that can perform thousands of transactions per second but cannot be termed as ‘true blockchains’ since they are ‘distributed digital databases’ being run on a private network. Nevertheless, in whatever form it runs, blockchain (or whatever we eventually may call it) remains a promising technology."
"Two days later, Xiaomi launched the Mi Mix 3, the most premium smartphone in its lineup with 5G. The phone boasts several firsts for Xiaomi—a nearly bezel-less 6.4-inch OLED display with 93.4% screen-to-body ratio, four cameras with slider mechanism and Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC. It comes in three storage and memory variants with up to 10GB RAM and 256GB internal storage.


The answer is, it doesn’t. That’s because the 5G enabled Mi Mix 3 will start rolling out next year and it will be very different under the hood. It will be powered by the Snapdragon 845’s successor (which hasn’t been named yet) and will have a Qualcomm’s X50 modem that will allow 5G operations.


The modem will provide up to 5 gigabits per second download speed and will support advanced mobility features, including beam forming, beam steering and beam tracking.

"The Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPM— the principal enemy of Congress in Kerala— had last week announced P. Rajeev as their candidate from Ernakulam. Rajeev was lauded across party lines as a former Rajya Sabha member and has been in charge of the party in Ernakulam for the last few years and editor of the CPM mouthpiece, positions that allowed him to build a rapport in the constituency.


In short, Rajeev is not all a weak candidate and this may have prompted the party to give the seat to a relatively younger face. Eden, 35 is the son of late Congress leader George Eden, who rose up as a student leader to become a two-time Ernakulam MLA. He has been rising up the influence-ladder within the Congress party and making himself deep rooted pockets within the Catholic church as well as the masses in Ernakulam, according to a regional leader who did not want to be quoted.


On the ground, Congress leaders who were known to be close to Thomas once have turned against the veteran leader and are seen to be rooting for Eden now. “We will accept any candidate suggested by the high command and work for his victory.

Equipped with a 1,920x1,080p resolution and a refresh rate of 144Hz, the 15.6-inch display looks vivid and razor-sharp. The anti-reflective coating puts less stress on the eyes in brightly lit conditions. This puts the OMEN notebook on a par with Asus ROG Strix SCAR (?1,54,990), which also offers a 144Hz display.


In terms of performance, the OMEN notebook was able to handle the likes of FIFA 18 and Far Cry 5 seamlessly, without any stutter.

"The Indus Water Treaty (IWT), signed in 1960 between the then prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru and president of Pakistan Ayub Khan, brokered by World Bank, put constraints on the usage of water resources for hydropower generation and irrigation capacity building for Jammu and Kashmir. This involves an opportunity cost—the J&K state under the treaty provisions is entitled to use river water resources for hydropower generation and shall not create irrigation capacity building beyond 1.1 million acres.


Hydropower generation is possible provided there is a dam of requisite height. The three rivers, subjected to IWT bottleneck, are Sindh, Jhelum and Chenab flowing through J&K and these rivers survive on snowfall in winter, which in any case is a lean period for power generation because of low level of water, which lasts seven months. Against 2,200 megawatts (MW) of power requirement the state produces hardly one-third of it in the lean period and is bound to purchase power from the centre. It has no resource to buy requisite amount of power and purchases just one-fourth of requirement against payment of ?6,000 crore, on an average per annum."

"The build-up to the OnePlus 7 has begun. The company’s next smartphone is ruling search rankings in India and worldwide, but let’s take a look at what the leaks really mean for us consumers.


It seems OnePlus has finally learned its lesson after the OnePlus 3, 5 and 6 series. The company has often taken flak for launching the 3T, 5T and 6T models soon after the originals. This year, OnePlus CEO Pete Lau confirmed to The Verge that there will be two devices at launch, the OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro.


In his conversation with The Verge, and an earlier tweet, Lau said that the OnePlus 7 Pro’s display will “redefine fast and smooth"".


While Lau wouldn’t confirm the same, it’s likely that the company is taking a page out of Asus, Razer and others’ playbook. The new display is likely going to have higher refresh rates (90Hz and above), which would theoretically make it feel smoother during UI animations, games etc.


Refresh rate refers to the number of frames a display can show per second. So, 120Hz means 120 frames per second. Fast refresh rates are usually required for gaming, which is why gaming phones have had such displays."

Could there soon come a day where popcorn movies like “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” arrive in theaters but more sober films like “Lincoln” go directly to a streaming service? It’s not a far-fetched concern given the film industry’s current trajectory


 Moreover, some important new voices whose work has emerged on Netflix — Dee Rees (“Mudbound”), Cary Joji Fukunaga (“Beasts of No Nation”) — have had their films excluded from theaters because the streaming service and the multiplex chains have been at loggerheads

Some Silicon Valley entrepreneurs say things like “the home of the future will have no kitchen and no garage"". While this may seem far-fetched, in some cities it is possible to see how this might be true. The rise of ubiquitous connectivity and a generation that values convenience suggests that it is worth re-thinking the idea of the city of tomorrow.


First and foremost, it is critical to recognize that the city has always been intricately intertwined with mobility. The attractiveness of urbanization—access to opportunity, diversity, culture, education—is largely about social mobility, but none of that is possible without physical mobility.


The aspiration of city residents has led to outward expansion. Finding an affordable home with sufficient space, living in a community of like-minded people, and owning a vehicle for the freedom to get around have all become characteristics of the peri-urban lifestyle. The result is an aspirational society that spends at least one hour of the day getting from one place to another.


The urban sprawl starts for similar reasons: overshooting of intended density and then affordability, forcing growing populations to expand cities spatially. This leads to suboptimal density of urban settlements and, in turn, lengthens commute and vehicle kilometers travelled, which in turn leads to de-densification."

"Apple has negotiated with the likes of HBO, Starz and Showtime but the centerpiece will be original programming


On March 25, a delegation of producers, studio executives and name actors will enter the subterranean 1,000-seat Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California, for one of those Apple showcases, with the chief executive, Tim Cook, commanding the stage before a crowd of loyalists.


This time around, the focus won’t be on the next must-have device. With iPhone sales showing signs of fatigue, the event is intended to draw attention to the company’s billion-dollar-plus bet on entertainment, an initiative that will put Apple in direct competition with Netflix, Amazon and HBO.


The premiere date for the service is getting closer, with the first of a dozen or more shows likely to start streaming before the year is out. At next week’s presentation, Apple is expected to reveal details of what it has been working on with stars from both sides of the camera like Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Brie Larson, Jason Momoa, Octavia Spencer, J.J. Abrams, M. Night Shyamalan and Steven Spielberg.


The tag line, “It’s show time,"" appeared prominently on the invitations. For many of the show-business people, this will be their first trip to Cupertino, the corporate home of their new patrons.


Apple didn’t need stars before, but it needs them now. Although the company was the first publicly traded American firm to be valued above $1 trillion, its most recent earnings report showed flat profits and falling revenue.


So the plan is not only to sell devices, but to fill them with content. That has led the company into the alien territory of Hollywood, where local customs can clash with Silicon Valley folkways.


Apple is a relatively late arrival to streaming. Netflix, Amazon and Hulu have offered original programming for several years and are now formidable presences at the Emmys. In 2018, there were nearly 500 scripted television shows available in the United States, with Netflix spending at least $8 billion on new content. Amazon, the Walt Disney Co. and Warner Media have increased their programming budgets to keep pace.


Apple has decided to put more emphasis on its services — think Apple Music and Apple Pay — to increase revenues. The strategy will include an expansion of Apple News, which is expected to be highlighted at the showcase, and the star-studded streaming service. Apple has negotiated with the likes of HBO, Starz and Showtime to populate its screens, Bloomberg has reported, but the centerpiece will be original programming."

But there’s no cherry on the cake, and by that, I mean Cherry MX switches. It’s unfair to expect one at this price point, but what’s the point of buying a gaming keyboard, right?

"Irrespective of the results, this will be the first election in the state since the passing of Jayalalithaa (in December 2016) and Karunanidhi (in August 2018).


If Karunanidhi dominated Tamil Nadu politics for half a century, Jayalalithaa shared this domination in a bitter rivalry with him for at least half of that period. Both left deep imprints on national politics as well. If Karunanidhi propped up at least two Union governments—the United Front in 1996 and the UPA I in 2004—Jayalalithaa toppled the BJP-led NDA government in April 1999 after giving it a hard time for 13 months, when its very survival depended on her support. Shortly after, she brought a Congress coalition tantalizingly close to power.


In the 2014 parliamentary elections, her party coined the slogan: “Modi or the Lady?"" Jayalalithaa swept the polls winning 37 out of 39 seats on her own, garnering an astonishing 44.5% of votes. But it was a pyrrhic victory, as the Modi-led BJP won a majority thus putting a wrench in her national plans, and Mamata Bannerjee’s ambitions as well.


Admittedly both Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa have cast a long shadow on Tamil Nadu politics. Predictions that the AIADMK will implode have been belied. The day of reckoning for the AIADMK government has been postponed with the chief minister Palaniswami skating on thin ice with more than a little support from New Delhi. If by-elections for 21 seats vacated by the disqualification of 21 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) for voting against the party’s whip is to be held simultaneously, it would amount to a general election to form the state government.


Elections 2019 will decide many things. How will the two Dravidian majors fare after the demise of their towering leaders? What will be the shape of the DMK in the post-Karunanidhi era? How many of AIADMK’s traditional voters will remain with the official party, and how much will be garnered by its challenger, Dhinakaran? Will smaller parties continue to tilt the scales?


But then these are the mere trees. One should not miss the woods. Ultimately, the big question is: who will have the finger on the nuclear button in the event of a coalition government? In plain terms, will Modi have a shot at power again by looking beyond the Hindi heartland? Or in other words, what can the BJP reasonably hope to gain from Tamil Nadu? Even a die-hard bhakt would not bet on more than one of the five seats. The bottom line for the BJP in Tamil Nadu boils down to little more than limiting the Congress’ victory.

Jyeshthoputro movie rating: 3 starsIt has been exactly six years since his death but filmmaker Rituparno Ghosh still presides over Bengali cinema


 In a city slowly waking up to capitalism, malls and multiplexes, his films attracted a primarily middle-class audience that headed to standalone theaters like Minar, Bijoli and Chabighar to see characters go through emotions that were pertinent to them


 The quintessentially Bengali aesthetics of his films seemed so true to their times that they became almost aspirational for the audience


Towards the later part of his career, however, Ghosh chose to make films that were, for the lack of a better term, more indulgent


 Even his biggest fan will admit that films like Noukadubi (2011), Satyanweshi (2013) and Chitrangadha (2012) were not a patch on his earlier films, Dahan (1997), Asukh (1999) and Bariwali (2000)

Warner said he is drafting legislation that would require Facebook to ""disclose the value of users' data, and tell users exactly how their data is being monetized.""


Human-powered content labeling, also referred to as ""data annotation,"" is a growth industry as companies seek to harness data for AI training and other purposes.


Self-driving car companies such as Alphabet Inc's Waymo have labelers identify traffic lights and pedestrians in videos to fortify their AI. Voice assistant developers including Amazon.com Inc have people annotate customer audio to improve AI's ability to decipher speech.


Facebook launched the Wipro project in April last year. The Indian firm received a $4 million contract and formed a team of about 260 labelers, according to the workers. Last year, the work consisted of analyzing posts from the prior five years.


After completing that, the team in December was cut to about 30 and shifted to labeling each month posts from the prior month. Work is expected to last through at least the end of 2019, they said.


The company said its analysis is ongoing so it could not provide any findings from the labeling or resulting product decisions. It has not told labelers the purpose or results of the project, and the workers said all they have inferred from their limited view is that selfies are increasingly popular.


The Wipro labelers and Facebook said the posts are a random sampling of text-based status updates, shared links, event posts, Stories feature uploads, videos and photos, including user-posted screenshots of chats on Facebook's various messaging apps. The posts come from Facebook and Instagram users globally, in languages including English, Hindi and Arabic.


Each item goes to two labelers to check accuracy, and a third if they disagree, Facebook said. Workers said they see on average 700 items per day. Facebook said the target average is lower."
"The pressure from moderation in aluminium prices can be seen on a sequential basis. Operating profit at the aluminium segment dropped 4.7% from the September quarter. But thanks to better volumes and realizations in the copper business, Hindalco (stand-alone plus Utkal Alumina) managed to maintain the operating profit at the September-quarter level.


With coal availability improving and crude oil-based raw material prices easing, the management expects the input cost base to either remain flat or moderate in the current quarter.


Further, with the US-based subsidiary Novelis Inc. seeing decent growth (operating profit up 5.6%), Hindalco should see another steady quarter (Q4 FY19), unless the global economic situation turns for the worse. “Cost competitiveness in Hindalco’s India operations driven by increased coal security, quick ramp-up of new capacities and high margins at Novelis/Aleris with higher proportion of automotive products in the mix continues to drive an upward earnings trajectory for the consolidated entity,"" analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd said in a 5 February note.

"This year, Huawei’s chief financial officer was arrested in Canada at the behest of the US. Photo: Reuters


Las Vegas: The CES 2019 gadget show, which kicks off Sunday, will showcase the expanding influence and sway of China’s rapidly growing technology sector. But some of its firms are stepping back from the spotlight amid rising US national-security concerns over Chinese tech and a trans-Pacific trade war launched by President Donald Trump.


Last year, a top executive of the Chinese telecom firm Huawei delivered a CES keynote address critical of AT&T’s abrupt cancellation of plans to sell a Huawei phone following espionage concerns raised by the US government. This year, Huawei’s chief financial officer was arrested in Canada at the behest of the US; Meng Wanzhou, daughter of Huawei’s founder, now awaits US extradition. No Chinese technology executives will deliver CES keynotes in Las Vegas this week.


There are fewer Chinese entrepreneurs buying up booth space to show off their latest technology — more than 20% fewer exhibitors than last year, according to registration numbers tracked by the South China Morning Post. Chinese firms still account for more than a quarter of the conference’s 4,500 exhibitors, second only to the US in sheer numbers. But some of the biggest names are taking a more subdued approach.


Internet company Baidu last year hosted a flashy event touting its self-driving software, but this year is sticking to a more conventional booth. E-commerce giant Alibaba is eschewing the big outdoor tent it helped erect last year in favor of quieter meetings marketing its voice assistant to business partners. The phone maker Xiaomi is simply skipping this year’s event altogether."

Bhakts, the gathering felt, were a creation of the media.


On defence, though, it was quickly pointed out, the Prime Minister had done good work. Whether this meant Modi would get another term in office was met with many a nod of agreement. As Pathak summed it up, “There is no vikalp (alternative).""

Every hardware innovation has been aided, in no small part, by software innovation. The software on the Mate X and other foldable phones is plain Android. There’s no effort, except in changing screen orientations (which was inevitable), to even do something clever with a screen that folds. Will we really use foldable phones for split screen apps only? Could Huawei not have put a clock on the curved part of the screen when it’s folded? And can Samsung think of something better? In fact, can the bar that holds the cameras on the Mate X have a separate battery that charges the phone whenever it is in ‘phone mode’? All questions worth asking.


Foldable screens are here, and unless the universe has other plans, they’re here to stay. But, it will be a while before they’re perfect and we will just have to wait for that"

It’s those kind of cognitive levels decisions where somebody has to be involved.

The impact of lower GST in the absence of input tax credit, therefore, will vary based on the region and the project. For instance, projects in Mumbai and Delhi or Gurugram, where land cost is high, may have less pressure on margins, as they can build in the increase in cost into the price. But those in south India, such as Bengaluru, and non-metros such as Pune, where cost of land is relatively lower, and the share of developmental cost is higher, will feel the heat on margins. Based on this, analysts are concerned about the negative impact on profit margins of firms such as Sobha Ltd and Prestige Estates Projects Ltd, which are developing projects at places where land cost is relatively lower."

"Censors are omnipresent. Nothing goes unmonitored and anything that even vaguely smells suspicious invites immediate reprisal. When a few Chinese bloggers humorously compared Chinese President Xi Jinping to the cuddly Winnie the Pooh, the government blocked all search requests for the beloved fictional bear.


According to Amnesty International, China has the largest number of imprisoned cyber-dissidents in the world. And it’s getting scarier. China is training and providing technology to other authoritarian regimes on net censorship. This is a serious threat to democracy around the world.


The government says that this will protect the country’s internet from foreign cyberattacks or other threats. But international human rights groups and Putin’s opponents say it is an attempt to restrict information flow.


The proposal is to route all Russian internet and data through a central point controlled by the state. Theoretically, this would allow the government to cut off the Russian internet from the rest of the global network. The law would grant more powers to Roskomnadzor, the Kremlin’s federal censor. This will be, quite simply, the new iron curtain.


India has a much better record on internet freedom. Governments have mostly concentrated on blocking porn sites and specific URLs that were allegedly spreading misinformation. In democracy watchdog Freedom House’s Freedom on the Net 2018 report (bit.ly/2zhm7tu), India ranks 30th among the 65 countries surveyed. But that could change for the worse and it could be done so smoothly by a clever government that we might not even notice until our rights were already severely curtailed.


With the elections beginning within a fortnight from now, echo chambers and fake news are grave dangers. And in the last few years, social media in India has been flooded with fake news and hate speech. Deliberately falsified or misleading content is a powerful tool in the hands of politicians. But it cuts both ways. Politicians can also use “fake news"" as a pretext to suppress facts. Our rationality will be facing some very tough tests in the coming weeks.


So, 30 years on, the internet needs some serious fixing. The very future of how we run our lives and societies may be at stake. Is it possible at all? In the words of Sir Tim: “Given how much the Web has changed in the past 30 years, it would be defeatist and unimaginative to assume that the Web as we know it can’t be changed for the better in the next 30. If we give up on building a better Web now, then the Web will not have failed us. We will have failed the Web.""

"The updates occur more frequently on Android compared to iOS, simply because there are more Android devices out there. According to a StatCounter report, 75.33% of mobile devices run on Android operating system (OS) while only 22.4% run on Apple’s iOS, as of March 2019. “Many users with a wide range of phones means there is more likelihood of your users experiencing a bug,"" says Sachin Dev Duggal, founder and CEO of Engineer.ai. Also, updates to iOS apps require a more stringent approval process than Android. Therefore iOS developer bunch together multiple bug fixes and do the updates less frequently, points out Anil Chopra, vice president-research and Consulting at CyberMedia Research. There is also the issue of OS fragmentation. According to the Android distribution dashboard published on 26 October, 2018, the four-year-old Android Lollipop runs on over 17% of devices while Marshmallow runs on 21% of devices.


Duggal points out that for numerous devices, a developer has to write multiple lines of code keeping in mind the Android OS and hardware compatibility. This can make the app bulky which is not so in the case of iOS.


Many of the updates are also rolled out to address bugs that originate due to compatibility issues with the custom user interface (UI) or version of OS."

The management has indicated that it would increase the pace of securitization of its loan book and the share of such securitization would be brought to 35-40% of assets under management.


DHFL may have done well so far to liquidate assets and repay maturing debt. But how long can it continue to service debt in this fashion is a question that has investors worried. As such, time is of essence and, unless banks are willing to uncork lending and bond investors turn friendly, DHFL may indeed default.

"It takes a group of young men 45 minutes to locate a dusty photo of RJD strongman Lalu Prasad in his house in Phulwaria, the village where he was born. (Pradeep Gaur/Mint)


Lalu Prasad has built a reputation as a mass leader who drew crowds with his inimitable style of canvassing


In the 2015 assembly elections, Lalu Prasad led the alliance that blocked the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) entry in Bihar


GOPALGANJ/CHAPRA: Phulwaria in Bihar’s Gopalganj district is like any village in the Hindi belt, and chances are most people haven’t heard of it. But, it is the absence of its most famous former resident that puts it centre stage in this Lok Sabha election. Phulwaria is the birth place of Lalu Prasad, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president and former chief minister, now serving a jail sentence in the fodder scam.


Though Prasad sought bail, which was rejected, to carry out “essential responsibilities as a party president"" ahead of the election, there are no photos or statues of him in his village. On one “new year greeting poster"" by a local RJD leader a tiny mugshot of Prasad jostles for space with 16 other leaders. It takes a group of excited young men and a 45-minute hunt to finally locate one dusty old photograph of Bihar’s former chief minister—but they are effusive in their praise of him.


“He is everything, our hero, our God. He once belonged to his village; now this village belongs to him. His absence has made this campaign dull. He was the voice of backward communities and that is missing now,"" said Chandan Yadav, a 23-year-old student who lives in the village. He dismissed Prasad’s conviction in the fodder scam as “a political conspiracy"".


Currently serving his sentence in Ranchi, this is the first election in which Prasad is not campaigning since launching the RJD in 1997. It’s also the first election he’ll be missing in more than 40 years since joining student politics in the 1970s. He was elected to the Lok Sabha for the first time in 1977 at the age of 29. He has since served as five-time MP, four-time MLA, Union railways minister, twice chief minister and Rajya Sabha member.


Prasad has built a reputation as a mass leader who drew crowds with his inimitable style of canvassing — whether his animated mimicry of opponents, his catchy one-liners or social engineering like his appeals to ‘MY’, or Muslim-Yadav support base. RJD is contesting 20 seats this election as part of the ‘mahagathbandhan’ or grand alliance with the Congress, which is contesting nine seats."

A high school drop-out, Mohanty likes his workplace, Sanand, in Ahmedabad, but given a chance he would like to settle down and work in his home state.


“I would like to stay and work in Odisha, but jobs are a real challenge here,"" he said at the Panchasakha complex in Puri district, which is known for its role in India’s freedom struggle and evolution of linguistic identity of Odisha.


Mohanty, 24, is not the only one. His two elder brothers are already working in Gujarat. His friends, including Manas Sethi and Somanath Malik, are also preparing to leave Odisha in search for jobs.

"The ride-hailing company is planning to start marketing shares to potential investors in a price range of about $44 to $50 each, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter isn’t public. Uber could aim to raise about $8 billion to $10 billion in the listing, though the final details of the pricing may still change, the people said.


At the lower end of the range the price would value Uber just above its last private funding round, in which Toyota Motor Corp. invested at a valuation of about $76 billion. Uber is taking a conservative approach to its valuation and could later raise the price depending on investor demand, the people said. Last year, bankers jockeying to lead the offering told Uber it could be valued at as much as $120 billion in an IPO.


The IPO is reportedly drawing big-name investors. PayPal Holdings Inc. will buy roughly $500 million of shares via a private placement at Uber’s IPO price, the Wall Street Journal cited unidentified people as saying.


Some recent big listings by technology unicorns have seen valuations come back down to earth after years of access to huge pools of private capital. Shares of Lyft Inc., which made its market debut in March at a $20.5 billion valuation, have since dropped 22 percent to well below their IPO price. Uber’s ride-hailing rival has a market value of $16.1 billion as of Thursday, much closer to its last private funding round at $15.1 billion."

"Holding elections in world’s seventh largest nation by area and second most populous country is humongous and complex


There will be 15 million voters aged 18-19 years voting in this year’s poll and millions more first time voters


NEW DELHI: It’s election season in India. The South Asian nation is preparing to hold general elections in April and May, in which about 900 million Indians -- more than the population of all the countries of Europe combined -- will cast their votes to select a new federal government.


India’s elections have been notoriously difficult to predict because of the endless possibilities of coalitions. It will be no walk in the park for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to retain power -- after five years in office his popularity is receding over concerns about his government’s failure to create the promised millions of jobs and as well as a lag in economic development.


But it’s no cakewalk either for the opposition Congress party -- led by Rahul Gandhi -- and its allies to snatch power as they have yet to gain traction with the electorate. Add to that, the political scene will become even murkier when the powerful regional parties spell out their strategy on multi-party alliances. Contributing to the uncertainty, it’s difficult to fully trust India’s opinion polls as they have repeatedly failed to predict outcomes.


Voters are electing lawmakers for the 543-member lower house of parliament, or Lok Sabha. In 2014, the Election Commission of India deployed 3.7 million polling staff, 550,000 security personnel, 56 helicopters and 570 special trains to conduct a five-week-long exercise in close to a million polling stations."

"In a poll campaign that has witnessed some high-voltage exchanges on nationalism and national security, Rajasthan’s south-western border belt is curiously quiet on the topic. The southern half of Rajasthan (comprising 13 of the state’s 25 Lok Sabha seats) goes to polls on Monday.


Despite the lukewarm traction for a strident anti-Pakistan viewpoint in these parts, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) campaign in Jaisalmer-Barmer has relied heavily on it. In a rally in Jaisalmer on Thursday, BJP candidate Kailash Choudhary declared: “Pressing ‘kamal’ (lotus, the BJP’s symbol) is like shooting down one terrorist"". Despite leading farmer agitations in the past and contesting in a state where farmer anger is rife, Choudhary’s only pitch is nationalism.


The BJP campaign in the Jaisalmer-Barmer region has been filled with errors. First, popular local scion Manvendra Singh (BJP veteran Jaswant Singh’s son) defected to the Congress in September 2018. Then, the BJP spent months trying to find a strong candidate and fell back on Choudhary, who is seen to be backed by the RSS. Finally, former chief minister Vasundhara Raje is widely perceived to be angry about being left out of candidate selection in southern Rajasthan. After weeks of “will she, won’t she"", Raje arrived in Jaisalmer-Jodhpur for the last two days of campaigning. But her arrival was met with mockery. “Maybe it’s a plot to make Choudhary lose,"" said Padam Shankar Singh, who was at Raje’s rally. The anger against Raje, who was voted out in December, is palpable.


Despite the odds, both Congress and BJP insiders say a “tough contest"" is on the cards and the result may come down to local caste dynamics. The reason: the Modi “leher"" (wave). BJP would have perhaps found the going easier in Jaisalmer if the campaign had been “nationalism plus"".

"The telecom playbook should be extended to mobility: active policy-setting, regulatory leadership, technology adoption, and private sector participation, leading to ubiquitous and equitable access to all forms of transportation.


Actors across finance, transport, and logistics come together in real-time while facilitated by a cloud service.


While this coordination is evident, it often goes underrepresented in the measured aspects of the mobility economy, barely accounting for 7.1% of the GDP contribution. In this light, MaaS has significant potential in India. We need to make it possible to get from one place to another, regardless of the mode of transit, with an easy-to-use interface and seamless payment.


With multimodal routing, booking, and billing, MaaS has potential to cater to the current market by creating a roaming ecosystem, wherein the perception of competition between public transport and para-transit is reduced. Various modes of transportation work together to form a single service. Involvement of a variety of transport leads to reduced over-reliance on one mode, while at the same time increases the attractiveness of public transport.


National and state governments should continue working together to further empower the digitization of urban mobility. This will strengthen the role of public transport investments and shape our cities to be fundamentally different from an inevitable expansive sprawl.

"“There is no doubt that a section of senior leaders of the SP have been opposed to the alliance with Mayawati. Akhilesh had to speak to Mulayam for this public meeting,"" said a senior SP leader involved in organizing the meeting.


SP members said Mulayam continues to have a substantial connect with the Yadav voter base of central Uttar Pradesh and that the public meeting is an endorsement of the alliance by the senior Yadav.


“Mulayam is playing a grand game to protect and promote his son. That is why he is trying to keep BJP happy by praising Modi while allying with Mayawati,"" said A.K. Verma, political science professor at Christ Church College, Kanpur."
"Modi, meanwhile, has donned the role of a statesman since becoming the Prime Minister of India, at least on Twitter. It is the second rung of the BJP which has kept its Twitter blades sharpened. Rahul’s aggressive debut in late 2017 also coincided with the opening of the floodgates into a new era of antagonistic political messaging on social media. All the major parties were by then online, and many had realized their electoral prospects and brand images were sufficiently impacted by what happened on social media. Congress leaders joined Twitter en masse; Akhilesh Yadav went from chief minister of Uttar Pradesh to opposition leader; and Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee moved to openly confronting Modi, and presenting herself as the consolidator of the regional challenge to the BJP regime.


Mamata has for nearly two years focused significantly on potential allies in other parts of the country. Mamata’s “national ambitions"" were initially crafted via banal Twitter greetings and birthday wishes, much before an “anti-BJP alliance"" became a publicly stated political goal. The firebrand Bengali leader exchanged online pleasantries with many politicians, from Omar Abdullah to M.K. Stalin, through 2017 and 2018.


However, being a non-Hindi speaking leader has its limitations. Mamata has been pushed to tweet far more in English than Bangla (see chart 3), denting the projection of an online persona which is closer to her aggressive, street fighter image. The Mamata on Twitter is a far cry from the Mamata in real life, although, even online, the issue of a national strongman invading Bengal is one of her favourite topics.


Unlike Mamata, Akhilesh has turned almost entirely inward, with Uttar Pradesh-centric issues dominating his attention span. Up until mid-2017, he had very little confrontational posturing, but the proportion of antagonistic tweeting increased dramatically around late 2017—uncannily mirroring Rahul Gandhi. Something clearly changed in the “political hawa"" in the run-up to the Gujarat polls of December 2017. Akhilesh who also largely tweeted in English till 2016 now relies almost exclusively on Hindi (see chart 3).


Mamata Banerjee mostly tweets in English in an effort to reach a wider national audience. Amit Shah and Akhilesh Yadav, however, rely heavily on Hindi.


Unlike Rahul Gandhi and Amit Shah, whose antagonistic tweeting lean much more significantly towards name-calling, Akhilesh uses a quirky “Lucknowi"" style of sarcasm, humour, and rhyme in his political attacks. Of all the politicians, Akhilesh is the most adept at metaphor and turns of phrase. In short, language and style are central to the public outreach of Akhilesh Yadav. As a result, almost unnoticed, Akhilesh has emerged as a key oppositional voice in the Twittersphere.


But the biggest beneficiary of online confrontation remains Rahul Gandhi, whose reach and virality have skyrocketed since the winter of 2017. Three significant findings emerge from a temporal analysis of Gandhi’s tweets. First, Rahul consistently gets more replies to his tweets than most other politicians and most of them tend to be from detractors. In short, while his messages are more viral, there is also a much more aggressive countering of his messages through direct replies."
"According to Cook, the world has seen approximately 100 new data protection laws being put into practice in the last year or so. And, for many of these countries, these are first-time laws.

“This means data protection is becoming a part of normal business for any organization. It has become an integral component of strategy and business,"" Cook said.

According to the same NYT news report, several insurance providers in US have tried to use war exemption to avoid claims related to cyberattacks.


However, a Risk and Insurance report claims that the policy in question in the Mondelez case is related to property with a bolted-on cyber element and is not a standalone cyber policy."

"The US, for its part, worries that the spread of Chinese technology and ideology in Southeast Asia means Beijing will increasingly push a strategically vital region toward authoritarianism, even as individual countries grow wary of becoming beholden to China. The spread of a Chinese-style internet is a problem for U.S. internet giants from Facebook to Google wrestling with increasingly draconian regulations over what they carry on their platforms, and how they store and handle the information pivotal to their dominance. Fragmented laws governing data are anathema to giant corporations used to harnessing the cloud for everything from search to video.


“If authorities in the region can convince Silicon Valley to play by their repressive rules, we’re going to see a drop in standards of privacy, surveillance, and freedom of expression on those platforms,"" said Tanya O’Carroll, head of technology and human rights at Amnesty International. “How Silicon Valley chooses to engage with the likes of Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia could set major precedents. They must not treat those countries as testbeds to tinker with people’s rights online.""


For now, U.S. social media is popular enough that in countries like Thailand they’re able to publicly resist attempts to rein in content. But in the longer term, there’s a real risk American companies could get supplanted by the likes of WeChat, TikTok and Alipay -- Chinese powerhouses that are venturing aggressively abroad, into music and social media or e-commerce. Tencent, Alibaba and Bytedance Ltd. are also seeding the region’s startups, courting a younger mobile-savvy consumer -- a generation that politicians need to maintain their grip on power.

"Facebook has been the target of probes by various governments after news broke about a year ago that it allowed the personal data of tens of millions of users to be shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Earlier this month, it came under fire for taking too long to take down a live video of a shooting in New Zealand and allowing it to be circulated across the internet. Millions of users also had personal information accessed via a recent breach.


Over the past year, lawmakers have focused greater scrutiny on the company and its immense influence, asking its executives -- including Zuckerberg -- to testify in front of Congress to explain the proliferation of misinformation, hate speech and election manipulation on the platform.


In his post, Zuckerberg proposes that 'regulation could set baselines for what’s prohibited and require companies to build systems for keeping harmful content to a bare minimum.' The tech industry has long said that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is vital to its ability to operate open platforms. The provision exempts companies from being liable for user-generated content.


Facebook built a content-scanning system that over the years has added rules based on reactions to changes in user behavior or public uproar after an incident such as the New Zealand mass shooting. Last week, the company moved to ban content that references white nationalism or white separatism from the platform.


When the website’s users or computer systems report posts as problematic, they’re sent to one of the company’s 15,000 content moderators around the world, who are allowed to take content down only if it violates a rule."

"But there are plenty of obstacles. Facebook has weathered more than two years of turbulence for repeated privacy lapses, spreading disinformation, allowing Russian agents to conduct targeted propaganda campaigns and a rising tide of hate speech and abuse.


Zuckerberg submitted to two days of grilling on Capitol Hill last April. All that increases the challenge of convincing users that Facebook really means it about privacy this time.


Encrypted conversations could alleviate some of those problems, but it could make others worse. Security is an ""admirable goal,"" said Forrester Research analyst Fatemeh Khatibloo.


""I'm just not sure it addresses the bigger issues Facebook is facing right now."" Facebook grew into a colossus by vacuuming up peoples' information in every possible way and dissecting it to shoot targeted ads back at them.


Anything that jeopardizes that machine could pose a major threat to the company's share price, which would also affect its ability to attract and retain talented engineers and other employees.


In a Wednesday interview with The Associated Press, Zuckerberg predicted Facebook's emphasis on privacy will do more to help the company's business than hurt it. While most of the stock market slipped in Wednesday trading, Facebook's shares gained $1.25 to close at $172.51."

As many as 2,709 of the 5,038 respondents were millennials (with 1,489 younger millennials), 1,188 were from the Gen-Z (born after 1996).


Of the remaining 1,141, nearly three-fourths belonged to the Gen-X (born between 1965 and 1981) and the rest were older. Millennials and post-millennial adults together account for roughly half of India’s electorate, with an estimated population, based on census projections, of 459 million in 2019.


Millennials or post-millennials are as likely to support or oppose reservations in jobs as the older lot. In fact, a slightly greater proportion of the older lot (42%) said that reservations should be abolished compared to millennials and post-millennials (37%). A similar proportion (38%) of millennials and a slightly higher proportion of Gen Zers (42%) think that reservations should be based on economic criteria rather than caste.

"Bhubaneswar: Facing certain amount of anti-incumbency after 19 years of power, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik is adopting innovative campaigns this election season to reach out to youth and build a conscious narrative that he is still the credible face for 4.5 crore Odias.


After a fitness video to quell the doubt over his ill-health, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik has now come out with micro videos where he is interacting with youth of the state and discussing how the central government is not giving the state its due on coal royalty and neglecting it on railway connection.


He is heard telling that seven of the 30 districts of Odisha still do not have rail connection despite Railway earning nearly ?20,000 crore revenue from the state and the centre has been neglecting the coastal state. “Guess how much of that (Rs. 20,000 crore) is invested in Odisha…they spend Rs.1000 crore. After BJP came to power, they have increased it to just 1100 crore. Odisha is the most neglected state. Even after 72 years of independence, still seven of our districts are not connected by the railways. Injustice to Odisha is injustice to our youth and their future,"" he says."
"On the other hand, silver coins held flat at ?80,000 for buying and ?81,000 for selling of 100 pieces."
"For example let’s take roads—earlier roads were constructed, but in the last five years, the constructuion of roads has doubled.


Similarly, the work in railways has doubled, electrification of rail routes has gone up three times. Has all this been possible without employment?


Today, our country has received the maximum foreign investment. GDP has remained stable, inflation too has come down. Our government has given loans to 170 million people without any bank gurantees. Of these people, 42.5 million are those who have taken loans for the first time. Considering that they have taken loans, they must have started some work with the money also. In the last five years, six lakh new professionals have joined the economy. These professionals must have employed some people. Is this not employment generation?


New vehicles have come to this country, so jobs for mechanics and drivers too must have been generated. According to a CII report, 60 million people have got jobs in medium and small enterprises. In the last 2-3 years, 5.5 million new people have enrolled for the government pension scheme.


All this data suggests that compared to previous years, employment has risen in the country. Even during the (Atal) Vajpayee government’s time, the Congress ecosystem spread slogans that there was no employment.


During the Vajpayee government, 60 million people got employment, while successive governments could generate employment for only 12.5 million people.


There are three aspects to the employment question—formal employment, informal employment and symbolic (employment). Let’s looks at formal employment. According to EPFO and ESIC data, we have created one million jobs every month and 12 million jobs every year. In the last four years, 5.5 million new subscribers have joined NPS (National Pension System). Approximately 10 million people are benefitting from employment generation programmes.


NASSCOM report also shows that employment in the IT sector has grown. Formal sector accounts for 15% of the total employment.


Now, let’s look at the informal sector, which accounts for 85% of the employment in the country. In the last four years, 170 million people have been given loans. A CII survey shows that in the last four years, 60 million new jobs were created in the MSME sector. In the last four years, tourists and tourism in our country has grown by 50%. Don’t you think that this would have generated new jobs in this sector?


Lakhs of Jan Seva Kendra are functioning across the country, don’t you think employment must have been generated here?


For the past many years, India has been the fastest growing economy. If we were to compare governments after 1991, it transpires that the average growth has been the highest during our government. Is all this possible without employment generation?


International reports suggest poverty has reduced drastically. Is this possible without employment generation? Foreign investment too has touched a record high. Is this possible without employment?


India has become one of (the) biggest startup hubs globally. Development of many app-based services has contributed to our startup economy. Is this possible without employment? West Bengal, Karnataka, Odisha governments claim to have created new jobs. Is is possible that states are generating employment but the centre is not?


People who make these allegations have done great harm to the country. We have followed the same system, same arrangements and same methodology which have been followed by previous governments. Just because the results now are better, questions are being asked about the processes followed, and the integrity of institutions are questioned.


If you lose an election, EVMs are blamed. If judgments are not to your liking, impeachment proceedings are initiated against the Chief justice of India. If the media does not report according to your liking, you call it sold out.


IMF and World Bank have accepted India’s growth story. The world believes that India is the fastest growing economy. If Modi has to be opposed, oppose him, but in the zeal to oppose Modi don’t attack and devalue institutions and India globally.


These days it is seen that abusive language has crept into electoral politics. Are political leaders at the top making efforts to deal with it?


I don’t believe that this thing has happened overnight. Earlier, news used to come 24 hours after the event and there was little space for reporting such developments.


Once, while campaigning in Gujarat, I said that a cat had crossed my path. Next day, newspapers reported that Modi called Sonia Gandhi a cat. What do you say to such a thing?


Just look at the language of the people who give lessons on use of graceful language. Look at the kind of reports media files when the parliament is in session. They call the house a battlefield. What will you say to comments of Sonia Gandhi who called Atal Bihari Vajpayee a traitor and Modi a Maut ka Sudagaar (merchant of death). It’s not that we haven’t faced the brunt of abusive language, but these days it's become fashionable to twist comments and give lessons on use of courteous language.


The BJP organized a big rally in West Bengal and the state is seen as the BJP’s new laboratory. How successful will you be in Bengal?


It’s not correct to say that the BJP sees Bengal as its new laboratory. Since 2013, I have maintained that in the absence of balanced regional development, India has suffered the most. From Punjab to Kerala, India has remained economically vibrant.


Despite the eastern part of the country being the most resource-rich region, it has lagged. This part of the country has produced the largest number of intellectuals, IAS and IPS officers. It’s been my belief that for the balanced development of the country, we have to make the eastern region strong by creating infrastructure and making investments. My task for the next five years is to make the eastern part of India economically strong.


Of the developed India’s image that I have in mind, the eastern region is a part of it and not a part of some politics. Someone might say that I went to Arunachal Pradesh twice, and may see politics in it. But my government has a different take on the development of the northeastern part of the country. Every 15 days, one or the other minister from my government visits the northeastern region of the country and spends time there.


Earlier, chief ministers from the northeastern states used to camp in Delhi and still not get time to meet ministers. I have changed all of this.


Similarly, I believe that West Bengal can become the epicentre of the development story in the eastern region. I want Kolkata to enjoy the same status as Chennai, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad in the economic sphere."

"One of the aspirations that the Indian government has stated is that they want 40% of the service provision around AI to be delivered by Indian companies over the next few years. India is investing hugely in data warehousing. Therefore, we want to see some of the UK’s leading companies linking with leading Indian companies to develop AI technology with a certain type of protocol. For instance, British Telecom has a very large capability in developing AI. And here in India, Infosys Ltd too has a similar capability. You can quite easily see both these companies working together on a specific project which would allow data to be easily available to allow AI to be created.


With regard to data sharing agreement between India and the UK, a critical part would be the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Indian Data Protection Bill. How would you achieve parity when GDPR is more advanced and more specific than the Indian law?


UKIBC urges the UK and Indian governments to create a business-led data garage under the UK-India Tech Partnership. This data garage would explore AI and associated technologies on a controlled open-source basis via sandbox protocols, link to the proposed National Centre for Artificial Intelligence, and work closely with a network of Centres of Research Excellence and their UK counterparts. Data agreement would be an enabler to a data garage. In theory, data garage will be like a virtual special economic zone."
"Congress has nominated Jaiswal, who has represented the seat thrice. Samajwadi Party (SP) candidate Shree Ram Kumar is also contesting the election from this seat.


The leather industry was once a key source of employment in Kanpur and the neighbouring area of Unnao. But the BJP-led state government ordered the closure of the tanneries in December. The directive, issued ahead of the Kumbh mela, was in line with the central government’s mission to clean Ganga.


“The tanneries were the main source of income. Each tannery employed 100-150 people who have now been left without jobs. The owners are looking to move to other states such as West Bengal where the rules are not as stringent. Our machines have been shut for months now. In such a situation, we want a change in government who can help us,"" said Ashraf Karim, who runs a leather tanning workshop in the region.


The opposition parties are trying to make the most of the situation. Addressing a public meeting after her roadshow in Kanpur’s Badda Chauraha, Congress’ general secretary for eastern Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, highlighted the concerns of the people who lost their jobs after the tanneries were shut down."
"Elections to Odisha’s 21 Lok Sabha and 147 assembly seats will be held simultaneously across the first four of the seven-phase polls. Biju Janata Dal's (BJD's) Naveen Patnaik is still the tallest leader, but the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has made some inroads into the state. Mint brings you a snapshot of the electoral joust.


Odisha’s literacy rate is 72.87%, as per Census 2011. It has a high rural population of 83.3% and a sex ratio of 979. The number of Odiyas in government and private sector jobs has risen, though its 17.54 million workers account for less than half of its population of 41.97 million. Odisha has the third-highest population of scheduled tribes among Indian states. Scheduled castes comprise 17.1% of the population. There are 31.84 million voters in the state. Odisha was a very backward state for long, but under chief minister Naveen Patnaik, it has made rapid progress in industrialization."

However, Kuo believes that the Cupertino, California-based company could still use LCP as the primary material for 5G antennas in 2020 iPhones."

Summing up, the FlexPai is a very crude and rudimentary rendition of the first generation of foldable smartphones. Samsung and Huawei have both shown that the real potential of foldable smartphones can be unleashed only with proper software optimisation.

After all, by their own forecast, headline inflation is likely to remain below the 4% target for two consecutive years now.


The central bank knows this is the right time to give a hand to manufacturers, by bringing down their cost of borrowing, thus giving a boost to economic growth. For this, RBI has brought its repo rate down by 25 basis points and governor Shaktikanta Das said that banks need to do more to pass on these rate cuts.


The key reason for this could be that although the central bank has brought the price of money down, it has done little to make its availability easy."

"A Mint analysis of the NFHS data shows that households with internet access are concentrated in the prosperous North Indian belt spanning Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh and Delhi. Jammu and Kashmir, Mizoram and Nagaland also reported high internet access, but the sample sizes for these states are relatively small.


The NFHS surveyed more than 600,000 households across the country in 2015-16. It is a rich source of data on household ownership of assets and amenities, though the database is primarily used to assess health outcomes. The telecom regulator provides some disaggregated data on internet connectivity for more recent years, but that data is skewed because of multiple internet connections in the same household. The NFHS data are thus the latest estimates of actual internet penetration from an official and large-scale, nationally representative survey.


A disaggregated district-level analysis shows that in 123 of the 640 districts from where data was collected, at least one-fifth of the population had household access to internet. In 50 districts, at least one-third of the population had household access to internet. It is in these districts that the internet battle for hearts and minds will be the fiercest.

"Intel and Samsung have supported the FTC in friend-of-the-court filings, arguing Qualcomm’s defense is outdated since its years of “dominance through innovation and hard work"" have been replaced with monopolistic practices. Those practices “suppress competition and harm consumers,"" Intel said in a May 2017 filing.


The FTC case and Apple’s rapid follow-up caused a selloff in Qualcomm’s stock on concern that its ability to charge for patents was under threat. That in turn led to a hostile takeover bid by Broadcom Inc. that was thwarted by the US government on national security grounds.


A key issue in the FTC case is how Qualcomm gets paid for licensing its technology. The company owns the invention by which multiple data streams can use the same set of radio frequencies.


None of its opponents deny that Qualcomm came up with innovative technology that is key to industry standards. They challenge the extent to which Qualcomm uses its patents on those inventions to extract fees. Currently the company gets paid a percentage of the total selling price of each phone sold. Even amid non payments and disputes, that revenue totaled $5.2 billion in its most recent financial year.


Qualcomm’s adversaries claim that’s unfair because there’s so much other technology that makes a phone attractive and useful to consumers that comes from elsewhere. They argue the company should set fees based on the price of the component that uses its technology. That’s a drop to the low tens of dollars from a basis in the hundreds of dollars.


The way Qualcomm sees it, without its technology smartphones wouldn’t be able to access the internet -- an iPhone would be an expensive iPod."

What inspired Shetty to explore story telling was that people spend a lot of time on social media and texting apps. “This is when we thought that people are very comfortable texting and consuming large amounts of content via messenger and other chatting apps. So can we tell amazing stories in the form of chat messages?"" Thus Plop started in early 2018 along with co-founder Vineet Shetty.


“We currently use many of the mobile phones’ native features like vibration, and backlights to add special effects to the stories. And we are experimenting with virtual reality to make the stories come alive,"" say Shetty. A majority of Plop’s users come from developed countries like the US, Japan and New Zealand.

"Amazon isn’t the only company that periodically gets caught up in cases of private records mistakenly made public


Facebook shared this kind of information freely with third-party developers for years, before cracking down more recently


Researchers at UpGuard, a cybersecurity firm, found troves of user information hiding in plain sight, inadvertently posted publicly on Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud computing servers. The discovery shows that a year after the Cambridge Analytica scandal exposed how unsecure and widely disseminated Facebook users’ information is online, companies that control that information at every step still haven’t done enough to seal up private data.


In one instance, Mexico City-based digital platform Cultura Colectiva, openly stored 540 million records on Facebook users, including identification numbers, comments, reactions and account names. The records were accessible and downloadable for anyone who could find them online. That database was closed on Wednesday after Bloomberg alerted Facebook to the problem and Facebook contacted Amazon. Facebook shares pared their gains after the Bloomberg News report.


Another database for a long-defunct app called At the Pool listed names, passwords and email addresses for 22,000 people. UpGuard doesn’t know how long they were exposed, as the database became inaccessible while the company was looking into it."

Such an alliance risks alienating and losing the support of Asaduddin Owaisi led All India Majilis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, which influences minority votes in Hyderabad and other parts of the state.


With the bifurcation of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in 2014, the Congress had expected to retain power in the former state in 2014 when assembly and Lok Sabha elections were held simultaneously in the two Telugu states. However, the polls witnessed the rise of the TRS, while the N. Chandrababu Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party won in Andhra Pradesh.


The Congress won 21 assembly and two Lok Sabha seats in 2014, but was completely wiped out in AP, failing to win even a single seat in either the Lok Sabha or the assembly and getting less than 5% of the votes. The loss was mainly attributed to the Congress being blamed for dividing the state by citizens.


Five years later, the scenario has become worse for the TDP in Andhra Pradesh, with the rise of the YSRCP. Hit with anti-incumbency, Naidu’s political future is perhaps at stake, as he is also leading the anti-BJP coalition with the Congress at the national level.

The government doesn’t have to demonstrate that this is the most narrowly tailored solution it could have chosen. And courts, generally speaking, are deferential to Congress and the president on matters of national security.""


American officials have long been concerned about the risk of using Huawei equipment. A 2012 report by the House Intelligence Committee urged US businesses to avoid the Chinese company’s products and called for blocking all mergers and acquisitions involving them.


In January, after unveiling indictments against Huawei and its chief financial officer, FBI Director Christopher Wray outlined the potential risk of growing too dependent upon foreign technology.


“These cases make clear that as a country, we have to carefully consider the risks that companies like Huawei pose if we’re going to allow them into our telecommunications infrastructure,"" Wray said. “That kind of access could give a foreign government the capacity to maliciously modify or steal information, to conduct undetected espionage, or to exert pressure or control."""

It’s hard to imagine how smartphones could get much better. Most are already zippy and equipped with jumbo screens, powerful cameras and face scanners. So what else can we look forward to?


It turns out, plenty. For a peek at the future of the phone, look to Samsung, the world’s largest handset-maker. On Wednesday, the South Korean company showed off a family of four new Galaxy phones that incorporate new technologies and features that may start spreading to other smartphones.


Of the four new devices, one will work on next-generation ultrafast 5G cellular networks, which means it can download a movie in seconds rather than minutes. Three of the models will have slightly larger screens and more complex camera systems than their predecessors.


And Samsung is also teasing a fifth device that can be folded and unfolded like a book to decrease or increase the phone’s screen size to suit its owner (though it’s unclear whether this gadget will go on sale this year).


There’s a lot to unpack here. Here’s what you need to know about what’s coming with screen sizes, cameras, 5G and the elusive foldable phone.


Many phone-makers, including Samsung, Apple and Google, have focused on making screens larger without adding bulk to their bodies. To do this, they stretched the screens from one edge to another while shrinking the bezels, or the borders surrounding the screen.


Samsung is continuing this trend. Its new Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus phones have 6.1-inch and 6.4-inch displays, up from the 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch screens on last year’s Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus. Even though the screens are bigger, Samsung said, the devices’ body sizes are more compact than their predecessors."

Pillai has been making a pitch to contest from Pathanamthitta early on, taking credit for the Sabarimala fight and highlighting his rapport with upper caste Hindu organisation Nair Service Society, according to a BJP leader who declined to be named. But Pillai's flip-flops during the Sabarimala campaign received him backlash from the two major factions in Kerala BJP, who have been lobbying for their loyalists for the Pathanamthitta seat. One faction led by V. Muraleedharan has been pushing for Surendran and the other led by P.K. Krishna Das have been pushing for MT Ramesh, said the leader.


Ramesh has previously said he did not wish to contest the polls if not picked for Pathanamthitta. While Surendran initially wanted to contest from Thrissur constituency, the seat is expected to be given to ally Bharat Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS), as its leader Thushar Vellappally showed interest to contest. Afterwards, Surendran's focus shifted to Pathanamthitta. By last week, Kannanthanam, also openly raised claims for the Pathanamthitta seat."

"Once you have got that sorted out, take a look at the power output. A 100-watt setup is an overkill for an apartment; a 10-watt setup is measly when you have Rob Bourdon on the drums. A 15-20 watt setup might be sufficient for most beginners and intermediate guitar players.


Then take a look at other options—pre-amp or gain, overdrive and gimmicks like an in-built BOSS pedal. See the dynamic range of the speakers. Play around with the EQ knobs. If you’re playing solos you’d require a good mid response, if you’re playing rhythm, you’d require great highs and lows. To really get the idea of how an amp sounds, it’s advisable you go to a guitar store and listen to it yourself.


It’s always advisable to get a separate pedal for getting creative with your tone and not rely solely on your amp.


Good beginner amp options include Fender Champion (20W), Roland Cube 20GX and Ibanez IBZ10G V2 (10W).


A stomp pedal or an effects pedal is a foot switch connected between your guitar and amplifier to provide more tonal creativity. Try listening to any Hendrix song played on an electric guitar—that’s a sound made by an effects pedal.


The types of effects are a function a pedal maker’s creativity (read craziness)—there are pedals that make different notes of a guitar sound like the notes in Super Mario’s intro track. Needless to say, the most popular are the less tacky ones. To begin with, you can choose from overdrive (mimicking the loudest volume on a valve amp), fuzz (listen it out here), reverb (repeating a note again and again every few milliseconds), loop (repeats a phrase you play until you turn it off) and “Wah"" (creates a “wah"" sound when the pedal is depressed).


A pedal has a particular effect with relevant parameters you can fuss around with to get the perfect sound, so it can be a bit expensive to create a “pedalboard""."

"“Whether that’s a privacy concern or not depends on how cautious Amazon and other companies are in what type of information they have manually annotated, and how they present that information to someone,"" he added.


When the Echo debuted in 2014, Amazon’s cylindrical smart speaker quickly popularized the use of voice software in the home. Before long, Alphabet Inc. launched its own version, called Google Home, followed by Apple Inc.’s HomePod. Various companies also sell their own devices in China. Globally, consumers bought 78 million smart speakers last year, according to researcher Canalys. Millions more use voice software to interact with digital assistants on their smartphones.


Alexa software is designed to continuously record snatches of audio, listening for a wake word. That’s “Alexa"" by default, but people can change it to “Echo"" or “computer."" When the wake word is detected, the light ring at the top of the Echo turns blue, indicating the device is recording and beaming a command to Amazon servers.


Most modern speech-recognition systems rely on neural networks patterned on the human brain. The software learns as it goes, by spotting patterns amid vast amounts of data. The algorithms powering the Echo and other smart speakers use models of probability to make educated guesses. If someone asks Alexa if there’s a Greek place nearby, the algorithms know the user is probably looking for a restaurant, not a church or community center.


But sometimes Alexa gets it wrong—especially when grappling with new slang, regional colloquialisms or languages other than English. In French, avec sa, “with him"" or “with her,"" can confuse the software into thinking someone is using the Alexa wake word. Hecho, Spanish for a fact or deed, is sometimes misinterpreted as Echo. And so on. That’s why Amazon recruited human helpers to fill in the gaps missed by the algorithms.


Apple’s Siri also has human helpers, who work to gauge whether the digital assistant’s interpretation of requests lines up with what the person said. The recordings they review lack personally identifiable information and are stored for six months tied to a random identifier, according to an Apple security white paper. After that, the data is stripped of its random identification information but may be stored for longer periods to improve Siri’s voice recognition.


At Google, some employees can access some audio snippets from its Assistant to help train and improve the product, but it’s not associated with any personally identifiable information and the audio is distorted, the company says. "

"The Chinese smartphone manufacturer today introduced the Redmi Note 6 Pro in the Indian market, the successor to the Note 5 Pro, pricing it at ? 13,999 for the base variant. Boasting an additional camera on the front housed inside a notched display, the Note 6 Pro has a few subtle tweaks here and there, but it’s very strong to its roots.


Keeping everyone busy with the buzz about the Note 6 Pro, Xiaomi silently killed the successor to its sub-Rs 10,000 champ. The Note 5 featured a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor with up to 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. A 5.99-inch display lit up the front of the phone along with a lonesome 5MP selfie camera. The rear of the phone sported a single 12MP camera with f/2.2 aperture. There was no word from Xiaomi on the successor to this phone.


Let’s superimpose the specifications of another similarly priced smartphone from Xiaomi, the Redmi 6 Pro. It’s got the same underpinnings, and costs just a thousand rupees more the Note 5. It has a slightly different display, measuring 5.84-inches diagonally with a notch. Some purists may argue that’s a reasonable decrease, but if you squint harder, Xiaomi has cleverly kept the same length but a shrunk down the width of the display. The dimensions of the Redmi 6 Pro seem smaller because the notched 19:9 display is spread much further to the bezels. It even weighs the same."
"Consider, for instance, the partnership Dell announced with Microsoft Corp. on Monday, during his keynote at Dell Technologies World 2019 in Las Vegas. Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, who attended the event in person, explained the rationale for the tie-up.

"And, as the two researchers showed, a neural network can learn to write phishing messages by inspecting tweets, Reddit posts and previous online hacks.


Today, the same mathematical technique is infusing machines with a wide range of humanlike powers, from speech recognition to language translation. In many cases, this new breed of artificial intelligence is also an ideal means of deceiving large numbers of people over the internet. Mass manipulation is about to get a whole lot easier.


“It would be very surprising if things don’t go this way,"" said Shahar Avin, a researcher at the Center for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge. “All the trends point in that direction.""


Many technology observers have expressed concerns at the rise of AI that generates Deepfakes — fake images that look like the real thing. What began as a way of putting anyone’s head onto the shoulders of a porn star has evolved into a tool for seamlessly putting any image or audio into any video.


In April, BuzzFeed and comedian Jordan Peele released a video that put words, including “we need to be more vigilant with what we trust from the internet,"" into the mouth of Barack Obama.


The threat will only expand as researchers develop systems that can metabolize and learn from increasingly large collections of data. Neural networks can generate believable sounds as well as images. This is what enables digital assistants such as Apple Siri to sound more human than they did in years past.


Google has built a system called Duplex that can phone a local restaurant, make reservations, and fool the person on the other end of the line into thinking the caller is a real person. The service is expected to reach smartphones before the end of the year.


Experts have long had the power to doctor audio and video. But as these AI systems improve, it will become easier and cheaper for anyone to generate items of digital content — images, videos, social interactions — that look and sound like the real thing.


Inspired by the culture of academia, the top AI labs and even giant public companies such as Google openly publish their research and, in many cases, their software code."

Last month, the Election Commission told the apex court that rules related to political funding could have serious repercussions on transparency."
"To define “style"" for the study, the Dartmouth researchers reference sentence length, the use of passive or active voices and word choice that could result in texts with varying degrees of simplicity or formality. The team used 34 stylistically distinct Bible versions ranging in linguistic complexity from the “King James Version"" to the “Bible in Basic English"". The texts were fed into two algorithms—a statistical machine translation system called “Moses"" and a neural network framework commonly used in machine translation, “Seq2Seq"". Neural networks are algorithms modelled on the human brain.


While different versions of the Bible were used to train the computer code, systems could ultimately be developed that translate the style of any written text for different audiences. As an example, a style translator could take an English-language selection from Moby Dick and translate it into different versions suitable for young readers, non-native English speakers, or any one of a variety of audiences, according to the researchers.

Women are emerging as a political force in Indian democracy as visible in the past two elections...with this, they will have (a) bigger voice in decision making. All the other parties which are paying lip service will have to follow; if not, will eventually lose their women base,"" Kumari added.


Continuing the battle for equal participation of women in politics, women activists from across the country in July 2018 launched a charter in the national capital, demanding the central government ensure that 50% seats in Parliament and legislative assemblies are reserved for women.


Praveen Rai, a political analyst at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Delhi, in his study published in South Asia Research journal, termed women’s increasing participation in Indian electoral politics as a silent feminization.


“The increased participation of women in formal politics reveals a process of feminization of Indian politics with positive, people-driven developments that augur well for Indian women and for India. The political parties that played a destructive role in scuttling the Women’s Reservation Bill in the last Lok Sabha have become redundant after the general elections in 2014,"" Rai said in the study."

"A Congress official said the BJP had the funds to reserve most of India's fleet of helicopters for hire for 90 days, making it difficult for opponents to get hold of them.


""We have never ever seen an election with such disparity. Financially, we cannot compete with them,"" said another veteran Congress politician, who asked to remain anonymous.


He and another high-ranking Congress official said they expected the BJP to outspend them by a factor of ten. A third Congress source estimated the disparity at twice that.


Two BJP officials declined to provide an estimate of spending, but one said the ""BJP definitely has a big war chest and has more funds at its disposal than the Congress.""


Congress has received far fewer funds because of a perception it is unlikely to win the election, political strategists said. The opposition party has been hampered by its inability to forge a national alliance to take on Modi and has struggled to capitalise on discontent against the BJP over a lack of jobs and distressed farm incomes.


Modi has been topping polls as India's most popular politician, well ahead of Congress President Rahul Gandhi.


Money has become critical in elections given the country's 1.3 billion population, its voting over 39 days and the sheer complexity of the electorate, in terms of region, religion, language, and caste.


A tradition of doling out freebies to sway voters only adds to costs. Authorities say they have seized goods and cash worth about $456 million since March 26.

"According to Nevo, it was this belief that led Google and his team to build a flood forecasting system trained using machine learning (ML) to provide a more accurate idea of which areas will be flooded so that people could be alerted in time. In fact, Nevo and his team ran a pilot in Patna, Bihar, during the 2018 monsoon, and achieved over 90% accuracy in terms of providing the actual representation of the water situation on the ground.


Google’s forecasting system is based on a scalable high resolution hydraulic model which, according to Nevo, can simulate the behaviour of water across the floodplain more accurately. The model helps in understanding how much water is going to be within a river system and exactly where it will flow. Existing forecasting systems that are modelled on the widely-used elevation data sets, like the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), often miss details of the topography resulting in water overflowing everywhere and spilling throughout the whole map, argued Nevo. He added that “SRTM’s maps are almost 20 years old""."

"Security researchers have long warned that misuse of enterprise developer certificates, which act as digital keys that tell an iPhone a piece of software downloaded from the internet can be trusted and opened. They are the centerpiece of Apple's program for corporate apps and enable consumers to install apps onto iPhones without Apple's knowledge.


Apple last month briefly banned Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc from using enterprise certificates after they used them to distribute data-gathering apps to consumers.


The distributors of pirated apps seen by Reuters are using certificates obtained in the name of legitimate businesses, although it is unclear how. Several pirates have impersonated a subsidiary of China Mobile Ltd. China Mobile did not respond to requests for comment.


Tech news website TechCrunch earlier this week reported that certificate abuse also enabled the distribution of apps for pornography and gambling, both of which are banned from the App Store.


Since the App Store debuted in 2008, Apple has sought to portray the iPhone as safer than rival Android devices because Apple reviews and approves all apps distributed to the devices.


Early on, hackers ""jailbroke"" iPhones by modifying their software to evade Apple's controls, but that process voided the iPhone's warranty and scared off many casual users. The misuse of the enterprise certificates seen by Reuters does not rely on jailbreaking and can be used on unmodified iPhones."

"The Galaxy A50 has a Super AMOLED display, which can be a massive advantage over the other two smartphone when it comes to media consumption


Mid-range smartphones have already flocked the Indian in the first quarter of 2019. Cameras with extremely high resolutions, premium build quality and chipsets with the stomach to fight the flagships devices of the yesteryear (to an extent) have become trademarks of these smartphones.


Three such smartphones are the Redmi Note 7 Pro, Oppo F11 Pro and Samsung Galaxy A50. Although belonging to somewhat the same price bracket, the three devices have very little in common. So which one is the right fit for you? Let's find out.


The Redmi Note 7 Pro follows Xiaomi's new all-glass design philosophy. The smartphone comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection on both, the front and the back. Underneath the back glass is a dual tone gradient, which is also present on the Oppo F11 and Galaxy A50. The Galaxy A50 is the only smartphone in the lot with a plastic back.


In terms of heft, the Galaxy A50 is the lightest, weighing at 166g, while the Note 7 Pro and F11 weigh around 186g and 190g respectively."

"Netflix declined to discuss its reasons for ending new subscriptions through the app store. But its move drew more attention to an app store tax that other technology companies have already attacked as an abuse of the power that Apple has amassed since opening its app store years ago.


Almost three years ago, Spotify also stopped accepting new subscriptions through Apple's app store. Its move followed the debut of Apple Music, which obviously doesn't have to pay any commissions.


""They're trying to have their cake and eat ours, too,"" Spotify spokesman Jonathan Prince told The Associated Press in 2016. ""We find it bad for consumers, unfair to consumers and ultimately something that could stifle music streaming subscriptions across the board.""


Spotify regularly harps on the unfairness of Apple's app-fee system in its securities filings. The company didn't respond to interview requests for this story.


Few other apps reach as many customers as Netflix and Spotify, making it unlikely that the rebellion against Apple's app store commissions will greatly swell, said Amir Ghodrati, director of market insights for App Annie.


Apple doesn't seem to be worried. In fact, it's reportedly demanding an even higher commission — roughly 50% — for a Netflix-like news service that it is trying to create with a variety of publishers, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report based on unidentified people familiar with the negotiations."

"Modi and nationalism may work in rest of India, but in Chennai, water and basic infrastructure matter the most


Whether the candidate is a newbie or a veteran, the voter blue or white collar, across Chennai, it is local issues that dominate campaigns and conversations


CHENNAI: On a recent Sunday afternoon, about 150 residents of Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) in Chennai’s southern edge settled into plastic chairs in the basement of a building in Sholinganallur—waiting for the candidates contesting from the Chennai South constituency to show up, take questions, and give their respective stump speeches.


One group was discussing tax-saving investments, another was busy listing out new real estate projects to invest in, and a third was joking about whether the candidates will try to slip them any money, since Tamil Nadu politicians are after all masters of cash-for-vote schemes. “I heard Semmancheri (a low-income neighbourhood down the road) got ?500 a house and they’re angry because the going rate this year is ?2,000,"" said a man as the others in the group chuckled.


On Tuesday night, in the frenetic final hours of campaigning, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) family’s prominent New Delhi face, Kanimozhi, was caught up in the middle of an income tax raid. Nothing of substance was found and the southern state went to bed after adding a few more conspiracy theories to the long list that has been circulating in Tamil Nadu ever since the DMK’s M. Karunanidhi and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (AIADMK’s) J. Jayalalithaa exited the political landscape.


In the Sunday afternoon circle, though, which was filled mostly with members belonging to the Federation of OMR Residents’ Associations (FOMRRA), cash distribution was hardly the key electoral issue. The federation is a citizens’ group which claims to represent close to 300,000 households in gated communities and apartment complexes that dot a posh 15-kilometre (km) stretch by the sea. They invited all the Chennai South Lok Sabha candidates, who would otherwise not be allowed into gated communities, to campaign, and most accepted. Among this group of city residents, cash-for-votes and nationalism don’t sell. What matters is more mundane and every day—water and sewage lines.


If pushed to talk about larger policy issues concerning national politics, Chennai voters pick the imposition of the NEET, and GST, and centre-state relations.


OMR or the IT corridor, officially called Rajiv Gandhi Salai, is one of the newer parts of the city—built hurriedly in the wake of an influx of information technology (IT) firms in the early 2000s. But even the relatively rich cannot escape the egalitarian failures of haphazard urban planning. In large sections of the IT corridor, water and sewage lines have not yet been laid, and the gated communities depend on a fleet of water tankers, and have their own sewage treatment plants."

Some test models of Samsung Electronics Co.’s new foldable phone have suffered defects after only days of use, casting a shadow over next week’s introduction of a $1,980 device meant to rejuvenate a flagging market and showcase the Asian company’s technology expertise.


Several publications, including Bloomberg News, outlined a bevy of problems with test versions of the device, which folds inward like a notebook.

"Thackeray was deep in love with Modi and the “Gujarat model"" through 2013-14. However, the unalloyed bhakt has turned a ferocious antagonist, a hard-hitting challenger. Thackeray is the opposition juggernaut that Modi-Shah, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had not bargained for, did not prepare for when election campaigning began. By the time Thackeray winds up his caravan, he could end up changing the state’s political matrix.


The bhakti, he now says, was an error of judgement—he fell for Modi’s public relations exercise, listened to people like Ratan Tata, visited Gujarat as Modi’s guest, but he has since woken up to the dangers of the Modi model. It’s a clever admission. It carries a subtext—Thackeray is telling Maharashtra that he, like many people, made a mistake in 2014 and they shouldn’t repeat it now.


In his utterances, demeanour, and willingness to take on the powerful, Thackeray is now the main opposition voice in Maharashtra. He is doing the work, the campaigning, the activism, and the confrontation that the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) should have; his earlier parochialism, muscle-flexing methods, violence as political tool are forgotten in the moment. The Congress and the NCP have, in a rare import from business to politics, out-sourced their work to Thackeray.


That Thackeray, a political write-off in 2014, is now Maharashtra’s chief campaigner for opposition parties shows the paucity of imagination in Congress-NCP and erosion of the opposition space. In the 15 years of Congress-NCP governments till 2014, the BJP and the Shiv Sena vied with each other to be the principal opposition party. Between BJP’s Eknath Khadse and Fadnavis, and Sena leaders including Bal Thackeray and his son Uddhav, they made sure that successive Congress chief ministers were kept on their toes with exposes of scams and critique of policies.


In May 2014, the Lok Sabha tally of 42 of 48 seats to the BJP-Sena coalition and the then prevalent Modi-mania made the BJP believe that it was time to end its 25-year-old alliance with the regional force. It called off the alliance with barely a month to go for the October 2014 election to the state assembly. The BJP emerged as the single largest party, with 122 seats in the 288-member assembly, but short of a majority. The Sena, battling odds, netted 63 seats. Eventually, it joined the government but it is an uncomfortable alliance.


The Sena, miffed at the treatment it received in Delhi and Mumbai in Modi-Shah-Fadnavis era, lost no opportunity to hit back, criticise and question Modi and Fadnavis. Its words were acerbic and meant to hurt the BJP, they were louder than those of Congress-NCP. Uddhav Thackeray came close to calling off the alliance a number of times but realpolitik prevailed. Through this, the Sena donned two hats at once – it was in government and it also became the “opposition""."

They continue to own them in the hope of a swift rebound and still seem to be happy sitting on the last cycle’s big winners.

The stocks they least expected to move and avoided owning may well turn out to be the big movers. The reason is simple. Investors are not yet ready to be nimble.

"A glance at four of the most critical emerging trends that could help us leapfrog from 'digitally advancing' to 'digitally evolved'


As India’s digital consumer rises fast-and-furious in 2019, enterprises need to develop new technology-based offerings and adopt business approaches that stand the best chance of pulling ahead of rivals in the future. We look at four trends that will emerge as most critical.


‘Size-does-matter’. With 462 million internet users in India today and looking to reach 821 million by 2021, this truly outlines the massive potential digital holds for India. Boston Consulting Group’s (BCG) analysis—Digital Consumers, Emerging Markets and the $4 Trillion Future—looks at emerging markets closely, and finds countries passing through three typical phases of digital development; Digitally Aware, Digitally Advancing and Digitally Evolved. India is seen Digitally advancing with the likes of Brazil and Indonesia, while Digitally Evolved mostly has western countries with the exception of China. So, what would make us leapfrog from Digitally advancing to Digitally evolved; and what can consumers and business’s expect in the days to come. In this article, we look at the key driving forces that make a difference."

Less than a tenth of the 289 billion-dollar startups are working on next-gen innovations. Why has everybody dropped the ball?


long-reads mint-india-wire Big technologystartupsPeter Thielartificial intelligenceStanley Kubrick2001: A Space OdysseyAutomated assistantsSiriAlexaUberSwiggySoftbankAI


This may seem like an odd time to question the ingenuity of the technology sector. With news of artificial intelligence (A.I.), automation and machine-learning swirling around, the technology space looks like a bright spot in a dull economy. Mega venture funds and frothy startup valuations seem to bear out this optimism.


Yet, fifty years ago we imagined a very different future. Stanley Kubrick’s classic 2001: A Space Odyssey released during the heyday of the space program assumed that by the early part of this millennium, space travel would be routine; machines would be terrifyingly intelligent; and computers and humans would have intelligent conversation.


By that yardstick, the present is decidedly underwhelming. Our phones have become smarter, interfaces slicker, and communication faster. But other predictions haven’t come to pass.


Most space programs are limited to unmanned expeditions. After the lull of the past few decades, space travel is in the news again. But even Elon Musk, the eternally confident founder of Space X, expects to send a manned expedition to the moon only in 2023, the first lunar journey by humans since 1972.


Driverless vehicles are not ready to replace humans yet. The vagaries of human traffic are just too much for these ordered systems. Robots, which are used extensively in manufacturing and distribution, haven’t been able to adapt to routine human tasks. Automated assistants like Siri are great for one-off tasks, but it’s near impossible to hold a conversation, especially with a thick accent.

New Delhi: Aarati Mehta, a Delhi-based designer, was tired of going to clubs and bars for parties. Her problem was that she would typically be around the same people at these parties.


A number of people today believe that bars and clubs have outgrown their usefulness, and are looking for alternative venues for parties. Some technology platforms are trying to take advantage of that.


A friend of Mehta recommended that she explore MyScoot—a web-based platform that lets people find house parties in their city. The platform started about a year-and-a-half ago from a Google form that was circulated on the internet. The company today plans to launch Android and iOS applications within months and currently operates in Delhi/NCR and Bangalore. “The platform is mostly for socializing. We started it because we ourselves weren’t able to find any avenues to meet new people,"" said Somvir Yadav, founder of MyScoot.


A similar platform called Lemonade Social began with the aim of helping creative professionals connect with an audience, and in the process help people meet each other. “Artists don’t want to play at bars and restaurants anymore because people go there to eat and drink. And you have a bunch of community-driven platforms that come out and say the same things that bars say—that they will keep the money but give you an audience. What we found was that users want experiences like this, but there’s no platform that’s combining different experiences, like music, food, etc,"" says Kritarth Chhabra, co-founder, Lemonade Social."
"The demand by the parties comes days before the 2nd phase of the ongoing Lok Sabha elections on April 18, when the a total of 97 constituencies across 13 states go to polls. The first of the seven-phase polls was held on April 11.


The Supreme Court had on Monday asked the Election Commission to increase the random matching of VVPAT slips with votes cast through EVMs at five polling booths per assembly segment, from one at present, in the Lok Sabha polls. It had given the direction saying the measure would provide greater satisfaction not just to political parties but the entire electorate. The opposition parties, including the Congress, have been demanding that at least 50% of all votes polled through EVMs be verified against the paper slips of the the voters' verifiable paper audit trail (VVPATs) machines.


A VVPAT is an auxiliary, independent device linked to an electronic voting machine to allow voters to see if the votes cast by them have gone to the right candidate. The VVPATs are also meant to help detect any possible ""election fraud"" or malfunction of EVMs.


The Election Commission of India has decided to use VVAPTs with all the EVMs in the ongoing elections to impart greater transparency and credibility to the country's poll process.


The BJP, meanwhile, termed the opposition parties' meet in Delhi an exercise ""to find excuses for their impending massive defeat"" in the Lok Sabha polls."

Additionally, cumbersome approval processes for the acquisition of infrastructure and prolonged environmental clearances also need to be addressed. The report also highlights testing the viability of a data centre’s location for high-seismic zoning, probability of floods, and extreme heat conditions–all of which could be a huge deterrent for players looking to set up centres in certain cities."

"In an age where cameras are coming up everywhere, making sense of all the hours of stored footage is where the next big policing breakthrough is likely to come from. (iStock)


A new technology is beginning to alter policing. It may have already helped crack a major case, the murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh


While gait analysis has been used as supportive evidence in the UK, its use for forensic purposes has been limited elsewhere


In September 2018, a special investigation team of the Karnataka police identified Parashuram Waghmare as one of the alleged killers of journalist Gauri Lankesh, who was shot dead in 2017 at her Bengaluru residence. The lead came through the examination of the walking pattern of the killers as captured in the CCTV footage at the time of the murder. The Directorate of Forensic Sciences in Gujarat, which was working with the police on the investigation, used a technique called forensic gait analysis to match the walking pattern of the killers with that of the suspects.


Forensic gait analysis is based on the premise that every individual’s walking pattern is unique. It comes in handy to identify a person in cases where the CCTV camera has captured the act of the crime but couldn’t capture the face of the perpetrator due to poor lighting, the position of the camera, or because the face was covered with a mask or cloth. The technique was first admitted as evidence by a London court in a murder case in 2000. The perpetrator caught on CCTV footage had a bow-legged gait matching one of the suspects, which according to the gait expert who offered testimony during the trial was found in only 5% of the country’s population.


During gait analysis, the walking style of the perpetrator from the CCTV footage is examined to generate a pattern called gait signature. It is then compared with the gait signature generated from a second footage of suspects, which can be from a CCTV footage captured before or after the crime or a re-enactment of it by law enforcement agencies during the investigation as was done in Gauri Lankesh murder investigation. Gait signature is drawn from combination elements such as the posture of the body while walking; hand swing; the position of head, neck and shoulder; knee-flexion during stance; distance between the steps; angle of feet; pelvic rotation and weight distribution.


If done right, forensic gait analysis could possibly revolutionize policing in ways similar to the impact that fingerprint analysis had on the field in the early 20th century. Crime solving is all about matching the remnants of a scene to the person who might have been there. While a fingerprint or hair or blood are clear markers of identity, the way someone walks could be as unique and integral to identity. And in an age where cameras are coming up everywhere, making sense of all the hours of stored footage is where the next big policing breakthrough is likely to come from.


Gait analysis can be done manually by carefully examining every frame of the footage and then drawing a conclusion based entirely on observations. The other and considerably more reliable approach is the computer vision approach, which uses specially designed algorithms to determine a person’s gait from a video footage and then compares the gait pattern of the perpetrator with that of the suspect. This approach uses software tools to measure lengths or angles of the limbs during movements across each frame."

"“We were seeking implementation of the Agenda of Alliance while trying to evolve some mechanism to engage the youth,"" PDP’s youth leader Waheed ur Rehman Parra said. “In Kashmir, the people who dominate the streets are below 18. Even militancy recruitment stops at 25. But we had nothing to engage with them. Regardless of the withdrawal of cases against first-time offenders, thousands of the youth started facing law and thanna became their only centre of adverse engagement. This led to the crisis.""


“Mark my words,"" Omar Abdullah said days after Burhan’s killing. “Burhan’s ability to recruit into militancy from the grave will far outstrip anything he could have done on social media."" His grave actually became the ‘new recruiting shrine for militancy’. In 2018, Kashmir witnessed 99 anti-militancy operations and 57 of them took place in south Kashmir. As many as 85 civilians were killed in the region in 2018.


Today, south Kashmir has more homegrown militants than foreigners. Every death required a funeral and every funeral was a huge gathering. “The politics took a different route for engagement,"" Parra said. “These funerals were a rejection of the idea of democracy; these were celebrations of death as BJP ensured PDP fails to deliver.""


These young, well educated, homegrown rebels are a breed apart. “While I was desperately looking for my brother and cousin so that I could convince them to renounce militancy, I visited 112 families of militants; almost 90 of them told me the security grid interventions forced them to join militancy,"" Syed Tajamul Imran, a management graduate said. He has already buried his militant brother but his cousin, a police deserter, is still at large.


In Kareemabad, the PDP got 1,400 votes in 2014. “Now we have seven graves there. How will we go to seek a vote and how will they actually oblige us?"" Parra asked. “In the first term, PDP gave Awantipore the Islamic University and in the second term an AIIMS. In the aftermath of Pulwama suicide attack, a school teacher was brutally killed. This devoured the development narrative from us. We have not even visited the area.""


This situation created indifference towards democracy well before the Lok Sabha elections were announced. In the 2018 fall, when Kashmir governor Satya Pal Malik decided to hold urban local body elections against the advice of the PDP and NC, south Kashmir responded interestingly. There was very low participation—130 of the 263 municipal wards remain vacant.


Right now, talking publicly about PDP in most of the region is a sin. But its loss is unlikely to be an NC gain because the PDP continues to be the major political force in the region. That is where the fault line lies. A tectonic alteration can be disastrous."

"In China alone, an average of two new models were released each day last year for a total of 764. In 2017, that figure hit 1,054, according to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology.


The saving grace for smartphone makers these past few years has been the addition of new functions, which allowed them to reverse a previous slide in average prices and actually sell devices for more money.


Apple Inc. thinks that average sales price is more important than shipment numbers, which is why it decided to no longer tell you how many iPhones it sells but merely how much revenue it makes from them.


That didn’t prevent the Cupertino-based company from missing its original sales target for the December quarter. Apple blamed it on China, while my colleague Shira Ovide blames it on Apple and explains why the shoe was bound to drop.

We may be a constituency, with a shared mindscape of moods and expectations, but we may very well be from different planets.


As long as he can remember, Manjunath's family grew millet and silk in a countryside 10 km from Bengaluru airport. He turned into a cab driver when farming became difficult. The once green pastures ran dry with overuse of groundwater, a story that repeats itself across Indian states. People in his village could not find water even 1,000 ft below the ground, he said."
"The Samsung Galaxy S10 launch event at San Francisco saw the launch of nine devices, including a foldable smartphone and wireless ear buds


The Samsung Galaxy S10 starts at $899 (about ?64,000), while the top-of-the-line S10 Plus goes all the way up to $1,600 (about 1.13 lakh) for the 12GB/1TB variant


Samsung launched nine devices, including Galaxy Fold, S10, S10 Plus and S10e at its Unpacked event held in San Francisco on Wednesday. Although headlined by the aforementioned devices, the event also saw the launch of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active, Galaxy Fit and Galaxy Buds.


The Galaxy S10 family comes with a completely refreshed design—a near bezel-less Infinity-O display at the front with a laser cut hole to accommodate the front-facing camera(s) and horizontally placed rear camera system.


The changes obviously aren't just cosmetic—the innards have received an upgrade as well. Samsung's Exynos 9820 or Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855 SoC is standard on all devices. Memory and storage options range from 6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage on the base Galaxy S10e all the way up to a whopping 12GB of RAM and a terabyte of internal storage on the Galaxy S10 Plus. All Galaxy S10 variants run Samsung's new One UI based on Android Pie 9.


Other specifications like front and rear cameras, fingerprint sensors and battery capacities differ from model to model. Here's how they look:


Undoubtedly the most anticipated device of the lot, the Galaxy S10 boasts a 6.1-inch Dynamic AMOLED display with QHD+ resolution. The Infinity-O cutout here is for a single camera—a 10MP clicker."
"However, as of now, there is no confirmation about what developers or games would choose to integrate Snapchat's Bitmoji avatars.

The most utilitarian phone of the lot, the Zenfone Max Pro M1 is easy to be overlooked. But once you get past the glamour of other phones, you see the genius of this one. It comes with up to 64GB of internal storage, 6GB of RAM, Snapdragon 636 processor and a humongous 5,000mAh battery. While the camera performance can be named as run-of-the-mill, this is the perfect smartphone for those who are always on the go and don’t have the time to charge up their phones. The UI is one of the more bearable ones and has some really useful features as well.


The Motorola One Power is very similar to the Zenfone Max Pro M1, except that it has a better 6.2-inch display with a pixel density of 402ppi which is more spread out to the edges. It has the same 5,000mAh battery which has fancier charging options like Turbo Charging with a USB Type-C port.


Motorola also has promised a Pie upgrade for this phone, so it is definitely a must buy for those with a peeve to be updated with the latest Android versions.


The Note 6 Pro is a marginal upgrade over the already awesome Note 5 Pro, except that it could have waited a bit longer. It gets an upgrade in its battery capacity, which has been upped to 4,000mAh and an additional camera at the front. The rear camera is great, just like its predecessor, and can give the best camera phones mentioned above a run for their money. The display is also spread out further to the bezels. The rest of the phone, from the processor to the overall design, remains the same. It is still a very good buy at ? 15,999.

Some of the biggest consumer complaints involve expense, laggy or glitchy graphics and the fact that many systems still tether the headsets to gaming consoles or PCs.

New York: Just a few years ago, virtual reality was poised to take over the world. After decades of near misses, the revolution finally seemed imminent, with slick consumer headsets about to hit the market and industries from gaming and entertainment to social media ready to hop on the bandwagon.


But the buzz over VR has faded to a whisper.

New Delhi: The annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) held in Las Vegas has typically been the Mecca for tech gadgets and trends. Not so any longer. CES 2019, for instance, is showcasing a bunch of iterative consumer technology products. Here’s why some of the top product announcements at CES 2019 have failed to excite us:


LG might call this the TV of tomorrow, but it’s more like the TV from yesterday. That’s because while the company launched the first mainstream television with a rollable OLED screen this year, it originally debuted at CES 2018, which in turn was an expansion of the rollable OLED technology the company showcased in 2016."

"There is hardly any violence in the Ted Bundy movie Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile, which premieres on Netflix on Friday and stars Zac Efron as the notorious serial killer


 It was a deliberate choice on the part of the filmmaker, Joe Berlinger, now something of a Bundy scholar with this fictionalized film and his popular Netflix documentary series, Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes


Plus, Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile is told from the point of view of Bundy’s girlfriend, Elizabeth (Liz) Kloepfer, a single mom who dated Bundy for about six years starting in 1969 and through some of his trials


“It’s based on what Liz would have seen, which is nothing,” said actress Lily Collins, who plays the part of Kloepfer


 “In order to make the audience feel like they’re in the mindset of Liz at the very end of the movie, you have to earn that


 And it almost heightens the anxiety because you’re teetering on the edge of ‘is he or isn’t he guilty?'”Collins and Efron decided to take the leap into the darkness of this story together"

"PC gamers have plenty to rejoice about as Nvidia has announced three new products in its GeForce GPU (graphics processing unit) line-up. At the top of the ladder is the RTX 2080Ti, followed by RTX 2080 and the RTX 2070. What sets them apart from the GTX 1080 and other Series 10 GPUs from 2016 is the new Turing architecture, which is designed differently from the Pascal architecture used in its predecessors. Turing-based GPUs are built on the 12nm (nanometer) manufacturing process, support GDDR6 memory and come with Tensor and RT (Ray Tracing) cores, in addition to Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) cores. GPUs based on Pascal architecture are built on 16/14nm manufacturing process, support GDDR5 RAM and consists of CUDA Cores. According to Nvidia, this makes the GPUs six times faster and better at handling 4K HDR gaming at 60fps than its predecessors. “Turing opens up a new golden age of gaming, with realism only possible with ray tracing, which most people thought was still a decade away,"" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, at the Gamescom gaming event last week in Germany


CUDA, is a GPU technology, which speeds up the processing power by executing thousands of tasks simultaneously using its multiple cores. The new GPUs have up to 21% more CUDA cores than the earlier versions."
"For the very first time since 1996 assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir have not been held on time. The Lok Sabha polls, however, will be a dry run for the BJP, PDP, NC and the Congress and help them assess where they stand if assembly elections are conducted after the Lok Sabha polls.


The ruling party at the centre has its work cut out in the region, with zero presence in the valley, according to political analysts.


“There is a sharpening polarization when it comes to valley-based parties and the BJP. It’s too small a time frame to expect any kind of metamorphosis. If the Election Commission gives the go-ahead for polls, no party will contest that. However, everything will depend on what happens on 23 May (the day the results of the general elections will be announced),"" said Ellora Puri, professor of political science, Jammu University.

"It also exposes non-Apple hardware users to the company’s products, potentially pushing them to Apple devices when it is time to upgrade.


The move will give Apple another revenue source for people who purchase movies and TV shows through iTunes, and signals another potential slot for the company to place its long in the works original video content service, which is plans to introduce as early as this year.


In order to compete with Netflix and Amazon Prime’s original content offerings, which have been around for a number of years, Apple will need as much reach as possible. Samsung TVs held 33% of the smart TV market last year, beating out Vivo, LG, and Sony, according to Statista.


According to Munster, the deal also signals that Apple has no imminent plans to enter the physical TV space. Opening up iTunes to Samsung TVs means that Samsung television users no longer need to purchase an Apple TV set-top-box in order to access Apple content. The deal also includes support for AirPlay, which means iPhone users will be able to stream video content from their phones to Samsung TVs."

"According to Icra Ltd, the pace of financial closure for infrastructure projects had improved by 50% between FY16 and FY18 from 430 days to 194 days, which gave investors the comfort to back these firms.


Sadly, in the last few months, delays in announcing the appointed date even after financial closure by banks, has become a concern, and stocks have mirrored the sentiment. This, despite the high order books and revenue growth in the nine months of FY19. Shares of Dilip Buildcon tumbled 55%, while that of NCC Ltd, Sadbhav Engineering Ltd (the engineering, procurement and construction or EPC) arm of Sadbhav Infrastructure) and IRB Infrastructure Developers Ltd were down 35%, 52% and 41%, respectively, in the past year.


The delay in mobilization advance paid by the government (which happens after the appointed date is fixed) has increased the working capital outlay for some firms. This is not a good sign. It implies higher interest cost, which in the final analysis, affects the rate of return on the project."

"In the Kaspersky case, the company sold software to the US government until 2017, when American officials expressed concern the products could be used by Moscow to spy on federal information systems. The Department of Homeland Security directed federal agencies to remove its products from government systems and Congress then codified the ban against the Russian company under the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, which President Donald Trump eventually signed.


Kaspersky filed two lawsuits: One sought a declaration that DHS harmed the company’s reputation and sales without due process; The second claimed the NDAA violated the Constitution’s “Bill of Attainder Clause,' which forbids Congress from enacting laws that inflict punishment on individuals and corporations without a trial.


A federal judge in Washington dismissed the suits saying the bans were within the scope of government authority. A federal appeals court agreed, concluding Congress had the right to block purchase of a specific vendor’s software if it has legitimate security concerns, saying the ban was a “prophylactic, not punitive"" measure.


“Given the not insignificant probability that Kaspersky’s products could have compromised federal systems and the magnitude of the harm such an intrusion could have wrought, Congress’s decision to remove Kaspersky from federal networks represents a reasonable and balanced response,"" the appeals court said.


Huawei’s Texas lawsuit offers a new twist, arguing the US extended the ban to include not just its own purchases, but to government contractors and those who receive federal money. Without due process, the Chinese company said the prohibition amounts to a “death penalty"" for its business."

"Consumers take it for granted that gadgets will keep getting slimmer, more powerful and cheaper, but the chip companies are running out of ways to etch ever smaller circuit patterns onto silicon. (AFP)


After two decades in development, chipmakers are making a costly bet on a technology that will cram even more transistors onto silicon


After two decades in development, chipmakers are making a costly bet on a technology that will cram even more transistors onto silicon. Their success may hinge on a little-known company in the suburbs of Tokyo.


Lasertec Corp. is the world’s sole maker of equipment that tests glass squares slightly bigger than a CD case that act as a stencil for chip designs. By shining light through the squares, circuits smaller than the width of a few strands of DNA are imprinted onto silicon wafers in a process called lithography. These templates have to be perfect: even a tiny defect can make every single chip in the batch unusable."

"However, many of the participants feared that the photos of children could lead to cyberbullying, stalking and kidnapping. “Identity theft is no joke. Photos can reveal a lot about your lifestyle, your habits, and they can unintentionally give away your data,"" cautions Toni Birdsong, family safety evangelist for McAfee, who authored the survey.


A few years ago, Google was accosted by a Canadian woman whose photo in a compromising position was captured by a Google Street View vehicle while she was relaxing on the steps of her home. The photo ended up in the Street View platform.


Though Google had blurred the face of the woman, they did not blur the number plate of her car which made her identifiable. In 2014, an iCloud flaw led to a major privacy breach involving hundreds of private photos of celebrity users. In another more recent case from March 2019, a mobile tracker app, MobiiSpy used by parents to monitor their children, was accused by security experts for leaving 95,000 images of users unprotected on servers that were accessible to anyone.


Clearly, these incidents pose a serious question on how many of platforms are handling users’ photos and whether they are taking the requisite steps to protect them from cybercriminals."

"In 2014, the UPA, Manmohan Singh and Congress were sliding. Now, we have Modi sarkar, and the BJP is quite resourceful. They have not achieved what they promised in 2014, but the BJP campaign in Odisha is very new. BJP is very aggressive in the state. They say we are a defunct (electric) transformer, our reply is: We are no more dependent on transformers, as we have set up electric grids. Organizationally, BJP is not strong, but they occupy public space via the audio-visual media which propagate their view. The election resources with them are a huge challenge (for us). Was it necessary to have a four-phase election in Odisha? You have one-day elections in Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, but four-phases in Odisha. Once you lengthen the election process, it targets the regional party to a great extent.


That’s not true. Naveen babu is our leader, he is the chief minister. Our policies revolve around him. In the last five years, his stature has grown, especially among youth and women. Reservation of 33% seats for women has gone down well. We are highlighting how both the BJP and the Congress have betrayed the interests of Odisha in the last 10 years. We will support a government (at the centre) that will protect the interests of the state. We believe no national party will be in a position to form a government on its own.


It’s not that people are forced to migrate. Undergraduate girls are trained here in sewing and are working in Coimbatore and Tirupur for better opportunities.

The more our people go out, they earn more, the state becomes richer."
"The TV business has also become enormous for all stakeholders in the ecosystem. Telcos and ISPs like Jio and Airtel want to ensure they have a lot more knowledge on the video consumption pattern.

"The channel carries the picture of Modi on its logo. It was launched on March 31, nearly two weeks after the Model Code of Conduct came into effect and ahead of the Lok Sabha polls beginning April 11.


The channel, available on various DTH and cable TV platforms, broadcast election rallies, speeches of the prime minister and interviews of BJP leaders.


Maintaining that ""the contents are being broadcast in complete violation of the rules and regulations of cable televisions"", the Congress, in its complaint, said the Union ministry's list of permitted private satellite channels in the country did not mention NaMo TV, so either the channel ""Content TV"" is being broadcast as a ""government-sponsored channel"" or lacks official clearance from the ministry.


The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) also complained to the EC, saying the BJP had launched the channel and though a party could have its own channel, it asked the EC if permission could be granted ""even after the Model Code of Conduct is enforced"".


Though the ruling BJP has maintained that it does not own the channel or the platform, its official Twitter handle had urged people to watch it for the prime minister's election campaign.


Union minister Piyush Goyal had also tweeted about the channel number while asking viewers to watch the prime minister's events."
"The PMK’s decision to join the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance could be deemed opportunistic, since it had until recently publicly criticised both the AIADMK and the BJP. The alliance is also expected to rope in actor-turned-politician Vijayakanth’s Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam.

"The poll watchdog found no violation of the model code of conduct (MCC) in the statements where Modi had slammed Congress president Rahul Gandhi for contesting from Wayanad in Kerala.


The move is significant as the opposition Congress has stepped up pressure and petitioned the Supreme Court over alleged inaction by the EC on complaints against Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah. The EC’s decision on the Wardha speech came just a day after the apex court agreed to hear Congress’ petition.


In a complaint filed with the EC, senior Congress leaders earlier this month alleged that Modi referred to?Gandhi’s contest from Wayanad as a seat where the “minority is majority"" and that he had made a reference to “Hindu terrorism""."

He added that through the alliance with BBM, which has also formed a coalition with several SC, Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Castes (OBC) and Muslims, known as the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), both parties are looking to pull away a good chunk of the 35% of minority and SC/ST votes in these districts."

"Dhinakaran gave anxious moments when he defeated the official AIADMK candidate in the R.K. Nagar assembly constituency that fell vacant after Jayalalithaa’s death. Thanks to the BJP’s support, it has been a steady ride downhill for Dhinakaran—his houses and property were raided; he was himself jailed on charges of bribing an election commission official in his bid to win the official electoral symbol of the AIADMK. Despite this, the beaming smile on his cherubic face gives the AIADMK leadership the jitters. Most political pundits agree that, even if his party, the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK), cannot win a single seat, he can seriously dent the AIADMK’s victory chances.


Despite providing opportunistic and self-serving support, the BJP has kept the AIADMK on tenterhooks. The present Tamil Nadu government has had the houses of both its chief secretary and the director general of police raided by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Raids on a couple of minister’s houses add to this dubious distinction. Not too long ago, BJP president Amit Shah dubbed the AIADMK as the most corrupt government in India and heralded a “kazhagangal illa Tamilagam (a Tamil Nadu without the Kazhagams)"", analogical to a Congress-mukt (free) Bharat.


Why then the decision to ally with the AIADMK? Put simply, the BJP has nothing to lose. Since 2004, neither the AIADMK nor the DMK has allied with the BJP. What the BJP can bring to the alliance table is exponentially less than the damage it can do to its ally. In other words, aligning with the BJP amounts to the proverbial Dhritarashtra Aalinganam (embrace)—in idiomatic English, the kiss of death.


In 2004, the BJP contested six seats in alliance with the AIADMK. Fifteen years later, after completing a full term as the first majority government in a quarter of a century under a charismatic leader as prime minister and a shrewd strategist as party president, the BJP will, in fact, contest one seat less! Surgical strikes, across the border bombing of terrorist camps, etc., seem to have had little bearing on seat sharing. How does one explain this curiosity?


Perhaps no other sitting prime minister has scored so low on the popularity charts in Tamil Nadu. H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral were obscure, but not unpopular. The euphoria evoked by Narendra Modi in many sections of the Indian populace and regions has singularly been absent in the state. Anti-Modi slogans are deeply popular. #gobackmodi is a trending hashtag whenever he deigns to visit the state. Inexplicably, everything that goes wrong in Tamil Nadu is attributed to him.


In the hugely popular pro-Jallikattu protests in January 2017, anti-Modi slogans were legion though he had little if anything to do with bullfighting. It was a repeat during the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) controversy (the national common medical exam was seen as Delhi’s imposition against the wishes of Tamils). Every slight to Tamil pride, every perceived threat to Tamil identity gets associated with Modi.


Last year, on a visit to Chennai, he barely stepped on Tamil soil. Unfortunately, it is hard not to think that the prime minister has taken this personally. By refusing to meet distressed farmers from the Kaveri delta, by making only a token appearance when the Ockhi storm hit, of all places the only constituency had BJP won; and not visiting the state at all after Cyclone Gaja struck, the prime minister has tended to alienate himself from the Tamil electorate.


The feuding party leaders of the BJP’s Tamil Nadu wing have not helped in mitigating this unpopularity. Tamilisai Soundararajan, the party’s state unit president, has made it a regular habit of putting her feet in the mouth. H. Raja’s intemperate remarks have caused much revulsion. As a shrewd commentator remarked, as long as the BJP relied on the likes of Tamilisai and Raja, Tamil Nadu was safe from Hindutva."

"The childhood hometown of Mahatma Gandhi, who was always rather sceptical of rapid industrialization, is home to more than 500 small and medium manufacturing units. Maruti Suzuki, the country’s largest carmaker, sources about 90% of its supplies from foundries or small factories in and around Rajkot.


Western Gujarat’s fourth-largest city, Rajkot is the seventh fastest-growing city in the world, according to a report published last year by UK-based forecasting and quantitative analysts Oxford Economics. Ramesh Monani, a retired banker and resident of the city, credits much of the growth of Rajkot to the industrious nature of the Patel community, which accounts for 13% of the state’s population.


The rapid industrialization is putting to the test the resolve of civic authorities and elected representatives as residents flag many infrastructure problems that come with a fast-growing city. Rajkot does not have a Metro, which means that most workers don’t have access to cheap, reliable and fast public transport. The migration of hundreds of workers from the Saurashtra peninsula of the state puts Rajkot under pressure to provide shelter, clean water, healthcare facilities and education.


As the city’s more than 1.88 million voters prepare to cast their ballots on Tuesday, these are among the issues on their minds. Posters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi populate most busy intersections with the occasional banner of Congress president Rahul Gandhi on the sides of roads."

U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw will open an eight-day trial on Monday to determine whether Apple violated Qualcomm patents around helping phones turn on more quickly and save battery life during tasks such as playing video games. Qualcomm alleges that phones with Intel modem chips, which connect phones to wireless data networks, violated the patents."

Commenting on the 72 hours timeline for furnishing user data, the Internet Freedom Foundation says that such short deadline for compliance can only be fulfilled by large social media platforms. This might make smaller companies over compliant to government demands for immunity resulting in a total disregard for user privacy.


Regarding taking down of unlawful content, technology policy researchers form National Institute of Public Finance & Policy (NIPFP) caution that overzealous implementation along with over reliance on technological tools for the detection of unlawful content would lead to the curtailment of online speech. They pointed out the instance where Facebook had removed posts documenting the ethnic cleansing of Rohingyas as it had classified Rohingya organisations as dangerous militant groups."

"But what’s surprising is the reported Aramco-Reliance deal valuation. The TOI report suggests RIL will carve out its refining and petrochemicals divisions into a separate entity, which will be valued at $55-60 billion. This values the downstream businesses at about seven times estimated Ebitda for the year ended 31 March. This will be attractive from Aramco’s perspective, but far from lucrative as far as RIL is concerned.


Note that a number of broking houses have valued the downstream businesses at much higher levels already. The median across the Street is upwards of $70 billion. It’s not like Reliance is a distress seller either. While its indebtedness has increased considerably in recent years after its aggressive foray into the telecom sector with Reliance Jio, leverage ratios haven’t gone out of whack. Net debt to Ebitda is around 3.7 times based on the current year’s debt and earnings estimates.


“RIL’s oil businesses generate high cash flows, which will take care of its debt.

SEBI had also mandated physical delivery of stocks in a phased manner. The first 50 stocks with smaller market capitalisation were to move towarda physical settlement by April this year, the next 50 in July, and the next 50 by October.

TMC members were named in the investigations in the Narada, Sharada and Rose Valley scams, and Banerjee is seen as having shielded the accused.

“I lost ?1.2 lakh in the chit fund scam and the state government has done nothing to act against the people responsible for it. We were not allowed to vote during the panchayat elections, but this time we are determined to vote. The presence of central forces will keep us safe. We do not trust the state police,"" said Nayan Krishna Ghosh, a 26-year-old farmer in Gangarampur village in Bholpur constituency.


There is also a perception that Banerjee is soft on the minority community and on illegal migrants from Bangladesh.


“We want the national register of citizens (NRC) to be implemented in West Bengal. There are many illegal migrants from Bangladesh and the state government is doing nothing. We will become a minority in our own state soon. The state government does not look at the rights of Hindus, it is only concerned about one section of people. The people of Bengal are not getting work because of illegal migration,"" said Dilip Biswas of Rao Tadi Choumata village in Ranaghat constituency.


Banerjee has ruled the state for nearly eight years, resulting in a sense of anti-incumbency, which the BJP is exploiting.

"In typical Oppo fashion, the camera wants you beautify you. Realme says it “factors in the aesthetic views of local youths in tuning cameras and optimizes selfie beauty features accordingly"".


It essentially makes your skin appear without blemishes and smoothens everything out, makes your eyes bigger, jaw slimmer and cheeks more protruding—depending on your settings. You can also put everything on the AI to make you look pretty.


Selfies without the AI selfie mode also look good, and I personally prefer myself with my small eyes. They are well lit and thanks to the wide aperture and pixel size, you consistently get well-lit images. I wish this was the camera at the rear of the phone.


The rear camera comprises a 13MP+2MP module, which is also powered with AI. Camera modes include AI scene recognition, multi-frame noise reduction, portrait lighting, pro mode and slo-mo. While the AI-scene recognition works well in well lit and semi-well lit scenarios, it’s a little difficult to use at night. Everything appears a bit too smooth, since high ISO and noise reduction are working hand in hand.


The pro-mode has one of the best implementations in any camera app period. It’s extremely intuitive and easy to use. No circular dials, no mumbo-jumbo, it is spot on.


Realme U1 ticks nearly all the boxes required to be a good sub-Rs 15,000 smartphone. A phone with the top MediaTek processor is a good addition to the Realme line-up and so is that selfie camera. The resemblance with the Realme 2 Pro is uncanny, but once you’re past that it’s a good phone very worthy of its price tag.

Realme has had a phenomenal run right after its launch in India. A counterpoint report said that the Oppo spinoff had become the third largest smartphone brand in India in six months. It also recently gave itself a new identity altogether, with a new logo and typeface, focusing on the youth.


One thing becomes clear after observing their new campaign—the company pictures the youth as a selfie and gaming obsessed crowd. A month ago, they launched the Realme 2 and Real 2 Pro, right after launching a video online which goes by the name “Proud to be Young"". While the Realme 2 was marred with a lacklustre processor and low-res display, the Realme 2 Pro was more of a complete package.


Then on Wednesday, the company launched the Realme U1, a phone they call the “Selfie Pro"". Boasting the newest (and the best) chipset from MediaTek, the phone is expected to add more variety in the sub-Rs 15,000 market. But does it really make sense for Realme to put out two very similar smartphones in quick succession? Let’s find out.


An untrained eye will fail to distinguish the Realme 2 Pro and Realme U1 from the outside. Both have exactly the same design, display, physical dimensions, weight and even the camera and loudspeaker grille placement. The only way to distinguish the two phones would be by their colour schemes.


The Realme U1 comes in three colour variants—Ambitious Black, Brave Blue and Fiery Gold. While Ambitious Black and Brave Blue are extremely similar to Blue Ocean and Black Sea variants of the Realme 2 Pro, the Fiery Gold is a new colour and that is the only way you can distinguish the two phones physically.


Realme claims rotating the phone’s back under different light sources (daylight, lamplight, colored light) reveals light pillars, which deliver a “strong sense of quality"". I second that."
"Under the hood, it is powered by MediaTek’s Helio P70 processor paired with up to 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. It runs ColorOS 6.0 UI based on Android 9 Pie. The smartphone is fuelled by a 4,000mAh battery with VOOC 3.0 fast charging support."

More details would be available at the time of launch. If you wish to check out the live-stream, you can view it on Realme's Twitter, Facebook and YouTube handles."
"By the third quarter of 2018, the market was flooded with smartphones that sported a notch cut-out, with varying shapes and sizes. In August, Oppo announced the F9 Pro, with a dew drop/tear drop/water drop notch. This quickly caught on with its sister brands, including OnePlus, and we saw devices like the OnePlus 6T, Realme 2 Pro and Vivo V11 Pro.


But Samsung refrained from using any notches on its smartphones and instead focused on bringing its “Infinity Display"" to its affordable handsets.


While Vivo Nex is widely regarded as “that smartphone with a pop-up camera"", it was also one of the first to sport an in-display fingerprint scanner, a technology that several other smartphone makers started to seek. The technology relies on an optical fingerprint sensor, which uses a light source to capture a high-resolution photograph of your fingerprints and uses algorithms to identify unique patterns. To capture a high-resolution image, it requires a light source, which has to be strong enough to illuminate your fingerprint. The problem arises when the light has to hit the sensor after bouncing back from your finger. As a result, this tech can work only with OLED displays, since an LCD’s backlight can get in the way.


The rudimentary renditions of this tech were quite cumbersome, especially in my experience. The speed is already slow to begin with (it takes anywhere between half a second to two seconds), and any type of interference—be it tempered glass or scratches on the display leads inaccurate fingerprint capture. If you’re a person prone to dropping your phone, this tech isn’t for you.


The first quarter of the year also saw facial unlocking become more accessible to people. While it is a little less secure than a physical fingerprint scanner, it’s more convenient.


But it’s unfair to assume that most smartphone tech surrounded around the display. Flip a 2018 smartphone and you’ll see a drastic difference from a smartphone of any era. You have glass backs, number of cameras ranging between one and four and striking colour gradients—it has become crazy out here.


While glass backs add an element of luxury, they also make smartphones extremely fragile. To fix this, some smartphones have started adding polycarbonate resin (a fancy name for faux glass plastic), which is shatter resistant and is more durable. It is also heat resistant, so during winters, these smartphones don’t get uncomfortably cold to touch."

"Loon joins a long line of ambitious projects aimed at helping underserved Africans. Facebook Inc. in June ditched a program to build passenger jet-sized drones to deliver Internet because global aviation and spectrum regulations don’t support the system. Instead, Facebook has said it will work with partners like Airbus SE on high-altitude connectivity.


Facebook in 2016 had to abandon an effort to provide internet via satellites when a SpaceX rocket carrying the rig exploded on the launchpad, but the company is working on another satellite program. And SpaceX itself plans to launch more than 4,000 low-orbit satellites to build a global broadband network—an initiative that will cost billions. “The continent is waiting for the promise of low-earth-orbit satellites to materialize,"" says Joao Sousa, a partner at tech consultancy Delta Partners. “If balloons beat the odds and succeed, it would be a game changer.""


Carriers are also trying to work around problems like a lack of rural power, with mixed success. Vodacom Group Ltd. has built solar-powered base stations and cell-phone towers in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, and Lesotho.


Loon is betting its Kenya project can be replicated elsewhere. Westgarth says he’s in contact with countries across Africa, Latin America, and Asia about similar agreements, which he says can lead to a profitable global operation.“When we first started talking with potential customers, the number of African operators that wanted a partnership was huge,"" Westgarth says. “As much as we want to do something good for people, we are a business, and we want to be a profitable business."""

Loon, spun out of the search giant's X innovation lab in July, is teaming up with Telkom Kenya Ltd. to build a network of high-flying balloons to connect people in the east African country starting next year


Bringing fast, widespread internet to rural Africa has proven vexing for companies that have tried—and largely failed—with strategies ranging from drones to satellites. Now, a sister company of Google says it has the answer: balloons.


Loon, spun out of the search giant’s X innovation lab in July, is teaming up with Telkom Kenya Ltd. to build a network of high-flying balloons to connect people in the east African country starting next year. The prize for Alphabet Inc., the parent of Google, is the opportunity to profit from advertising and other businesses tied to bringing the web to more of sub-Saharan Africa, where hundreds of millions of people lack net access.


Loon’s Kenyan project is modelled on technology used to temporarily connect people in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria last year knocked out power supplies and phone service. In Kenya, Loon says it will start with about a dozen balloons—enough to cover roughly 10 percent of the country—and gauge how many more are needed. Loon has begun work with the operator to install ground stations in Nairobi and the city of Nakuru in the western highlands that will beam signals to the balloons."

"While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has given more tickets to upper castes as well as other and extremely backward classes, the opposition is attempting a balancing act with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) fielding more Yadav candidates, and the Congress focusing on upper castes. The opposition mahagatbandhan is also appealing to smaller groups through caste leaders like Upendra Kushwaha, Jitan Ram Manjhi and Mukesh Sahani.


This time, the mahagatbandhan’s caste arithmetic looks strong on paper with the RJD confident of drawing support from Yadavs (14%), Manjhi from Musahars (3%), Upendra Kushwaha from Kushwahas (6%), Sahani from Nishads (6%) and Congress from a section of upper caste voters (17%), going by estimates. The NDA draws its support from the BJP’s chunk of upper caste (17%) and non-Yadav OBC voters, JD(U)’s Kurmi (4%) and EBC support and Lok Jan Shakti Party’s Paswan base (5%), which are also estimates.


As elections become more closely fought contests, caste consolidation will have to go beyond vote shares and convert into seats to yield electoral success. For instance, in the 2014 general election, the BJP had less than one third of the vote share (29.86%) but won more than two-thirds of the seats it contested (22 out of 30). On the other hand, the RJD won just four seats with a 20.46% vote share and the JD(U) just two seats with a 16.04% share. With such a keen focus on caste, voters feel the outcome of the general election will depend on which alliance is able to consolidate more on a seat-to-seat basis.


“It is rare to find leaders who work for everyone. If we vote in someone not of our caste, they will not work for us. We vote for our caste because we have to choose from what political parties offer. Frankly, there is very little to choose from because parties decide candidates on the basis of caste,"" said Prem Kumar Rai, a farmer from Gopalganj who also runs a general store."

Industrial robot sales in India also has rocketed and is expected to continue its momentum, driven by use cases across logistics, agriculture and manufacturing.


Blockchain is seeing significant investment across a range of industries. We see successful use cases where the trust paradigm needs to be decentralized (via the elimination of a central counterparty), large ecosystems need to be integrated and automation is critical. Governments across the world are leading the way and in some cases are mandating the use of this technology as they build next-generation citizen services and infrastructure platforms. However, on-boarding all players in an ecosystem is not easy and several critical technical issues including scalability will need to be addressed for this technology to achieve mainstream adoption.


VR (immersive computer-generated world) and AR (overlaying virtual environment onto the real-world) have been touted as technologies that will transform how we interact with the world, but their adoption across enterprises has been underwhelming. In the coming years, we expect the adoption of AR-VR in enterprises to grow rapidly, especially across use cases related to advertising, retail, healthcare and education and training. The AR-VR market in India is still in its infancy but is expected to grow due to positive impetus from the government, industry bodies and investors."

"The numerous tax incentives are unlikely to have a huge effect on realty firms in the listed universe. Here’s why.


The extension of the tax exemption for affordable housing projects by one more year until FY20 may spur more projects in the segment. As it is, between Q2 FY18 and Q2 FY19, about 55% of home sales were from units priced less than ?50 lakh across eight tier I cities in India.


However, higher sales volume would be offset by a fall in the average ticket size of residential units.

"Compounding the issue is an information vacuum. Page Industries did not specify how much of an impact the accounting change had on its revenue. Further, as analysts at ICICI Securities point out, it stopped disclosing segment-wise data, making it difficult to track category-wise product growth.


This is fuelling concerns about growth momentum at its mainstay inner wear business, where companies such as Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Ltd are making headway.


Of course, the shift to the organized sector on the introduction of GST will create enough elbow room for all market participants. But the question for investors is whether Page Industries can retain its market share."
"In 2014, Kerala’s 20 Lok Sabha members were elected with an average of just 4% vote share margin, compared to the all-India average of 14%, according to a recent Hindustan Times analysis.


Kerala is the only large state, where the BJP has not been able to win a single Lok Sabha constituency despite a huge presence of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Its vote share is only 10.8% in Kerala as of 2014.


“It (the 2019 Lok Sabha polls) is the most caste-based and communalized election in the recent past,"" said Kerala-based political analyst J. Prabhash.


“The BJP made its biggest effort to create a Hindu vote bank based on the Sabarimala issue. But we don’t know yet how the public is going to react. Now it is only on the realm of inferences. On one side, people had come out in favour of the court order. On the other, people had rallied in favour of the faith.

New Delhi: When you take a look at the smartphones of the past few years, it’s not difficult to call out which one belonged to which era. Here’s a fun thing you can try out: here are six pictures with six smartphones belonging to different manufacturers and different years. Try to guess the year the smartphones were manufactured in:


The first smartphone in the first picture is the Samsung Galaxy S4 launched in 2013, the second is the iPhone 3GS launched in 2009 and then you have the Xiaomi Redmi 3 launched in 2015. In the second picture you have the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge launched in 2014, the Apple iPhone X launched in 2017 and finally the Huawei Mate 20 Pro launched in 2018.


As you can see, there is a gradual shift in design and aesthetics of smartphones, and lately, it’s been dictated by four aspects—screen-to-body ratios of the display, the front and rear camera placement, choice of back panel materials and textures, and finally biometric options like a fingerprint scanner.


Many people like to think the race to eliminate display bezels was kickstarted this year by two major players—Vivo and Oppo—two brands belonging to the same umbrella company, BBK Electronics. It is no surprise that the two brands share their resources, along with Realme and OnePlus.


Vivo in June announced the Vivo Nex—the world’s first smartphone to feature a motorised front facing camera. Since there was no camera to obstruct the front of the phone, the display could be stretched further to the bezels; in fact, the Nex has a screen-to-body ratio of 86%, the highest at the time of its launch.


As more manufacturers explored possibilities in this area, we received rather interesting devices like the Oppo Find X, the Honor Magic 2 and the Mi Mix 3.


While this was a feature many premium smartphones carried, manufacturers also made the notch ubiquitous in affordable smartphones—a feature that was a symbol of luxury, thanks to Apple iPhone X."

For a premium user experience WhatsApp Video Preview feature will enable users to see a video right from the notification tray. The current version of WhatApp allows viewing of only GIFs and images from the notification bar but not videos."

"Gold prices on Thursday held near eight-month highs hit in the previous session, as the dollar weakened after the US Federal Reserve paused its monetary tightening cycle, putting bullion on course for its fourth straight monthly gain.


Spot gold was steady at $1,319.72 per ounce by 0308 GMT. Prices rose to their highest since May 11 at $1,323.34 on Wednesday. US gold futures were up 0.6% at $1,317.70 per ounce. Spot gold has risen 2.8% so far this month. The Fed held US interest rates steady on Wednesday but said it would be patient in lifting borrowing costs further this year as it pointed to rising uncertainty about the economic outlook.


""Gold is getting a double whammy from a dovish Fed and US-China trade talks. The US dollar has been sold off across the board, supporting gold,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst, OANDA. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell after the Fed's cautious statement. Gold tends to rise on expectations of lower interest rates, which reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.


Meanwhile, attention turned towards the US and China high-level trade talks that began on Wednesday, aimed at digging out from their months-long trade war."

"The company’s latest laptop is aimed at students from families with income of under ?2 lakh income per annum. RDP worked with a team from IIT Bombay, to make a special version of the Thinbook, meant for college students and bulk orders.


Design: Out of the box, the Thinbook actually impresses in terms of design. While it has a plastic body, the focus here is on keeping things utilitarian, but functional. The laptop weighs just over 1kg, helping keep a student’s bag light. It’s also thin and compact enough, so that it fits in almost any college bag along with books.


Performance: A factor that limits the audience for this laptop, though, is that it runs Debian Linux—an operating system that not many are familiar with. That said, if the primary audience is students who will use this to practise coding and access the internet, this may not be a problem.


One could easily argue that the Thinbook is extremely slow, except that alternatives like those made by better-known brands such as iBall or Micromax aren’t much faster either. The Intel Atom processors in these laptops were originally designed as mobile alternatives to PC processors, and they function accordingly with desktop software.

"However, we noticed a significant frame drop when the laptop was running without the power adapters plugged in. This is because the laptop’s desktop-grade hardware requires the 330 watt and 180 watt adapters to be plugged in to deliver the best results.

The laptop’s cooling mechanism works pretty effectively and keeps the chassis cool.

"I’ve written about the futility of cash transfers and how they do not help. Both parties are ambivalent on how the expenditure will be funded, or they will continue alongside existing subsidies. Partisan economists on both sides are busy picking holes in the other party’s scheme without recognizing the inherent weakness of all cash transfers.


In trying to hard-sell their own versions of the cash transfer schemes, both parties have unwittingly revealed their characteristic frailties. The BJP announced the scheme only for farmers with 2 hectares but has now promised to expand it to all farmers. The fine print in the Congress scheme discloses that actual payouts are likely to be delayed with the means-testing taking some time.


The overall tenor of the BJP manifesto is meant to appeal to the majoritarian, urban middle class with national security concerns, rather than a sluggish economy, occupying headlines. The 2014 manifesto had some pretensions of universality, which ""Sankalp Patra"" dispenses with.


The Congress manifesto, on the other hand, is bound together with a more inclusive and humane thread but is weighed down by one key genetic flaw: a subtle patronizing attitude, which is highlighted when the manifesto talks about enforcing anti-corruption laws without a tinge of irony."

As expected, the smartphone will replace the OnePlus 6, which was launched six months ago, as the OnePlus flagship in the market.


While it retains most of the design element of the OnePlus 6, it manages to look new, thanks to the teardrop-shaped notch on the top. It takes a lot less space than the earlier notch. However, not all apps support the teardrop and one can see black bars at the top while using them.

The two smartphones in the series, the Samsung Galaxy M10 and Galaxy M20 start at ?7,990 and ?10,990 respectively. This is a heavily populated segment of the market where Chinese budget champs like the Redmi Note 5, Redmi 6 and 6 Pro, Realme 2, Realme 1 are well established.


The Samsung Galaxy M20 is priced at ?12,990 for the 4GB/64GB variant, while the 3GB/32GB variant costs ?10,990. Galaxy M10 is priced at ?8,990 for the 3GB/32GB variant and ?7,990 for the 2GB/16GB. The smartphones would be available on Amazon.in and Samsung.com from 5 February, 2019.


The Samsung Galaxy M20 comes with a 6.3-inch FHD+ Infinity-V display. The Infinity-V is basically Samsung's rendition of the teardrop notch. The Galaxy M10 has a lower spec 6.2-inch HD+ display with the same Infinity-V notch."

"Among smart beds, Sleep Number 360 is quite popular in the US. It uses a proprietary Responsive Air tech to sense a user’s posture and movement, and then automatically adjusts the firmness and support for greater comfort. It can also tilt the head side of the bed upwards if it “hears"" the user snore and switches on the foot warmer if the user’s legs are cold. It has built-in sensors called Sleep IQ to monitor the user’s heart rate, breathing, movement and sleep quality. It is available in the US for $999.


Then there is the Sunrise smart pillow, which is slightly curved in the middle to provide more ergonomic support. The pillow has LED lights built into the sides that gradually brighten to simulate a natural wake-up process. It can also monitor the sleep quality, read out e-books and has a built-in alarm. Then there are anti-snoring pillows, which monitor breathing and gently turn the head to the side if the user starts snoring.


“Turning of the head to the side increases the gap between the tongue and throat, which stops the vibration of the soft tissues in the upper airways and reduces the snoring sound as well as allows better breathing,"" said Dr Sandeep Nayar, director and head of Centre for Chest and Respiratory Diseases at BLK Super Speciality Hospital in Delhi.


Another interesting innovation in sleep-tech is smart night pyjamas such as Restore. Developed by sleepwear company Lunya, Restore is made of cotton and Celliant, a synthetic fibre made from polyethylene terephthalate, with optically active particles embedded into the core. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2017. It can absorb and convert body heat into infrared energy and then recycle that energy back into the body for sound sleep. It can also increase oxygen levels to help relax the muscles."
"Prakash Behera, a legislator who left the Congress for BJP last month, agreed. “Several workers and leaders, who were working for the party, were ignored and their concerns not addressed, forcing them to leave the party,"" said Behera, adding that the party leadership in the state seemed to be favouring their own families while selecting candidates.


There is a buzz in the state about how the Congress abandoned its new “one family, one ticket"" rule. Odisha Congress chief Niranjan Patnaik is fighting from two assembly seats. His son is fighting as a Congress candidate from Balasore Lok Sabha constituency. Senior Congress leader Bhakta Charan Das is contesting from Kalahandi Lok Sabha seat and his son Sagar Das is fighting the assembly elections from Bhawanipatna, a segment in Kalahandi. Among others, the father-son duo of George and Rohit Tirkey is contesting for Lok Sabha and assembly elections."
"“Info Edge’s Ebitda missed our estimate by 6%, mainly because of higher ad expenses, up 25% QoQ and 97% YoY. Management noted a higher spend in Jeevansathi, in particular, leading to a sharp increase in losses, in response to greater competitive intensity,"" said Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a note to clients.


Thanks to all the valuation gains, the Info Edge stock is quoting at a rich one-year forward valuation of around 63 times earnings. However, the rise in valuations at this point perhaps reflects more-than-higher expectations built in as a result of Zomato’s recent funding round."

"Each new app is another revenue opportunity for Apple because it takes a cut of many app-related purchases and subscriptions. The company has positioned its services division as a major growth area. It plans to announce two new services — a premium Apple News subscription offering and an original video content initiative — at the end of March, Bloomberg News reported recently.


Later this year, Apple plans to let developers port their iPad apps to Mac computers via a new software development kit that the company will release as early as June at its annual developer conference. Developers will still need to submit separate versions of the app to Apple’s iOS and Mac App Stores, but the new kit will mean they don’t have to write the underlying software code twice, said the people familiar with the plan.


In 2020, Apple plans to expand the kit so iPhone applications can be converted into Mac apps in the same way. Apple engineers have found this challenging because iPhone screens are so much smaller than Mac computer displays.


By 2021, developers will be able to merge iPhone, iPad, and Mac applications into one app or what is known as a “single binary."" This means developers won’t have to submit their work to different Apple App Stores, allowing iOS apps to be downloaded directly from Mac computers — effectively combining the stores."
"Trend Micro researchers, too, pointed out last month that IoT has given rise to complex IoT environments (CIE) comprising at least 10 IoT devices that are functionally chained together and integrated into an environment using an IoT automation platform. For instance, a smart home has an internet connection throughout the entire CIE, which requires Ethernet or fiber wiring and modems and Wi-Fi routers.


Devices integrated into the environment can include a gateway, smart bulbs, smart locks, speakers and TVs. The complexity afforded by automation platforms, note Trend Micro researchers, expands the possibilities in smart homes and buildings and other setups in various settings. However, they caution that the increasing complexity with each additional device and automation rule also means an expanding attack surface.


For instance, if smart locks are installed and connected to the CIE, attackers could modify automation rules that would allow them entry into the home and make the sensors either recognize them as one of the homeowners or leave the doors unlocked. Attackers could also analyze and clone the owner’s voice and play the resulting sound file to bypass any voice recognition checks by connected devices in the CIE.


Homeowners, thus, should check automation rule files and make backups, advise the Trend Micro researchers. They should also enable two-factor authentication where applicable."
"The consolidation in the sector has hit tenancies and revenues, with companies such as Vodafone Idea Ltd getting rid of duplicate tower infrastructure. For Infratel, this meant that the sharing factor in the total tower base declined from 2.25 at the end of FY18 to 1.87 last fiscal (FY19). Total co-locations on the company’s towers dropped as much as 16% last quarter from the same period last year.


The impact of this will continue to be felt by Bharti Infratel. Several customer tenancies are in their notice period. Technically this lets Bharti Infratel to continue charge them. But such revenues will cease once the contracts end, further eroding Bharti Infratel’s earnings. “There were as many as 4,308 tenancies for which the company received exit notices, but were billed during 4QFY19. This is nearly 2.5% of the company's end-4QFY19 tenancy base. EBITDA could go down another 3-3.5% when billing on these tenancies stops,"" analysts at Kotak added."
"Google is testing a new feature, “Navigation suggestions for lookalike URLs"", that detects lookalike URLs (uniform resource locators) and flags them. It has rolled out Password Checkup, which tells users if their passwords have been compromised. The Chrome team is testing a “Never Slow Mode"" that trims resource-intensive web pages by limiting the resources to be allocated to images, style sheet, scripts and fonts. Google is changing the way ad-blocking extensions work by enforcing a new application programming interface (API) for extensions to enhance performance and user privacy.


Registering fake web pages with similar domain names is a common tactic used by hackers to lure users on to malicious web pages. Google’s move will help users who do not carefully read the URL names. Similarly, the Password Checkup feature will tell users which passwords are not safe any more, so that they can change or update them. With the new features, Google is trying to add a few extra layers of security within the Chrome browser. With Chrome version 68, rolled out in October 2018, it has started labelling all non-https (hypertext transfer protocol secure) websites as not secure."

"India is one of the largest gold importers in the world, and the imports mainly take care of demand from the jewellery industry. Gems and jewellery exports too dipped by 4% to $32.9 billion during the 10 months of the current fiscal.


India's current account deficit (CAD), or the difference between outflow and inflow of foreign exchange in the current account, widened to 2.9% of the GDP in the second quarter of the fiscal, against 1.1% in the year-ago period, mainly due to a large trade deficit.

"On the ground, the core support base of the BJP feels that the combination of Modi and Kumar gives the alliance the edge and the policy schemes of the central government, particularly rural electrification, adds its weight.


“Bihar is a contest between two alliances. One alliance has a prime minister and another has too many prime ministerial candidates. For people like us, the choice is clear as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done good work while the opposition camp is only about a few leaders coming together to defeat Modi,"" said Vijay Kumar, a seed shop owner in Danapur. The lack of a cohesive and larger opposition narrative other than ousting Modi is a factor in Bihar too as in other states.


Kumar could be a decisive factor for the NDA’s performance in the polls. While he is a popular chief minister who has returned to power, a section of voters hold it against him that he switched sides to join the NDA in 2015 after ditching the RJD-Congress combine.


“In 2014, in the general election, BJP got a lot of traction because the opposition camp was totally fragmented. This time what also matters is whether Nitish Kumar’s return to NDA bolsters its chances or not. While some in my village feel it has helped NDA, others feel Kumar could damage their prospects as he betrayed the mandate of 2015,""said Badri Narayan Shah, a farm labourer from Mehia village near Chapra."

"When Udaipur goes to polls on Monday, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be looking to break a pattern. Since the 1996 general elections, voters in the Lok Sabha constituency have always made sure they chose a new party and a new member of Parliament every five years.


“The Udaipur Lok Sabha seat mirrors the electoral pattern of the state of Rajasthan in the assembly elections. People like to change governments every five years so that politicians are held accountable and continue to work for them. This time, though, we may see a different pattern in Udaipur. People here are happy with the way the government has worked. This is the land of Maharana Pratap who was known for his bold steps, so we should get a government like that as well,"" said Parsavnath Mehta, a shopkeeper in Udaipur. (READ MORE)"
"The XR screen also falls short of full high definition, unlike the XS displays, although it can display video at 720p quality. Apple says that with LCD screens, higher resolution drains the battery faster, a trade-off that's minimal with the XS because its screen doesn't need a backlight.


That said, the differences are often hard to spot, even with the phones side by side. Where quality really matters, you'll probably want a bigger screen such as a tablet or a TV anyway.


Although the Max has the largest battery in an iPhone, the XR was typically on par with or exceeded the Max in battery performance when viewing video, especially at lower or medium brightness. In any case, either phone should give you enough battery life for routine use.


Cameras improve with each generation, and the new iPhones are no different. For many shots, the new iPhones blend four exposures rather than two, allowing for better lighting balance and more detail. In some shots taken in suboptimal conditions — against direct sunlight — the XR still showed trees in dimly lit areas, while last year's iPhone X produced pitch back. The new cameras also have better focus and low-light capabilities."

"“We need 2,000 to 2,500 litres of diesel for a two-week trip. All the costs for a fishing expedition, including food, wages and diesel, add up to ?2 lakh or ?2.25 lakh for a single trip,"" said Satish Patil, a fisherman who owns two boats. “Most trips barely cover the costs.""


Machimar or the fishing community accounts for a sixth or 42,000 of the city’s 246,119 votes. This seems like a substantial vote bank but for politicians, it’s not large enough. The city of Porbandar, along with six land-locked municipalities that comprise Porbandar district, has a total of 16.6 million voters. The number of fisherfolk votes in the district total about 65,000. This is one reason why the concerns of fishermen are not on the agenda of either the BJP or Congress as the state prepares to vote on 23 April. How does the fishing community plan to address this issue?


“We have many options. One way is to decide as a block that we will not vote. We’ll see what happens. But this issue needs to be addressed immediately,"" says Modi. A fisherman’s life, even if you own a boat, is no longer a respectable profession, and for this reason, most members of this community do not want their children to get into fishing. The number of fishermen in the district is increasing but it’s because of immigrants from neighbouring districts and states rather than the local communities themselves teaching their children the skills and traditional knowledge of the sea .


“I have two children. The older one is 17 and the younger one is 11 years old. Both are studying in private schools. With all these hardships we face as a community, none of us fishermen who can afford to offer a better life to our children will let them come into this business."""

Considering that Jats dominate the state’s politics, it is difficult for them to accept a non-Jat as a chief minister—the current CM is a Punjabi. Haryana, like Punjab, is home to self-styled godmen such as Rampal and Guru Ram Rahim Singh Ji, who have a dedicated following and can influence voting. Both Rampal and Ram Rahim are in jail.

Lastly, the company is adding a “Meet New Friends"" option that allow people to “start friendships with new people from their shared communities like a school, workplace or city"". This is an opt-in feature, meaning you will only see people who have opted in to this feature.


For Instagram, Facebook seems to be taking a more engagement focused route.

"Jadhav’s resignation brings the total of the lower house to 223 seats and the JD(S)-Congress tally to 116 (excluding the speaker).

Meanwhile, the Congress and JD(S) said that its seat sharing discussions were moving in the ‘right direction"" even though JD(S) supremo and former PM H.D.Deve Gowda has already made his intent clear to discuss seat sharing only with Rahul Gandhi and not with any state leaders.


Even though the discussions are yet to conclude, the JD(S) has already announced the Nikhil Kumar, son of Kumaraswamy and Prajwal Revanna, son of H.D.Revanna will be contesting from Mandya and Hassan, heralding the entry of the third generation of politicians from the Gowda household."

The party is expected to officially release these names later today: T. Siddique from Wayanad, Shanimol Usman from Alappuzha, Adoor Prakash from Attingal and K Muraleedharan from Vadakara, they said.


In the first list, Congress had chosen some heavyweights for the poll contest in Kerala, such as sitting MP Shashi Tharoor from Thiruvananthapuram and former MP K Sudhakaran from Kannur. It also led to some crisis moments as sitting MP from Ernakulam KV Thomas was axed, and which sent a buzz of his leaving the party and defecting to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). But eventually, Thomas was pacified by the leadership.


The inordinate delay of the list is a result of the pitched fight between the two groups in Congress, the 'I' group led by opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala and the 'A' group led by former chief minister Oommen Chandy. For example, both groups wanted to field their loyalists in Wayanad, ending up in a tussle. In the words of Congress leaders Joseph Vazhakkan, even a broom fielded under Congress name can win from Wayanad this time. Chandy wanted to field his loyalist T. Siddique from there but the 'I' group was unwilling to part away from its sitting seat."

From a survey we did, we found that in India, for example, 80% executives believe the workforce isn’t ready for AI. In the rest of the world, that’s 65%. But in India, hardly any company is investing in training the workforce. The rest of the world is no better—only 2%.


People appreciate the problem and understand that the workforce isn’t ready but they are not taking enough action to reskill their people. We believe that’s a big challenge, grand challenge of our generation."

"Others in the village have more pressing arguments. “People will vote on the basis of the kind of benefits given,"" said Ravi, who runs the local milk cooperative society. Most political parties have made a lot of pledges, ranging from farm loan waivers to direct cash transfers to minimum income guarantee schemes. However, comparing benefits alone may not work in Karnataka, according to locals.


The Janata Dal (Secular), or JD(S), and Congress swiftly circumvented last year’s fractured verdict in the assembly elections by adding up numbers, in the process overlooking the rough equation between the traditional rivals, who share a bitter and violent past. Since then, the level of distrust between workers, leaders and top brass of the two parties appears to have plummetted—it’s worse than when they worked as individual parties.


“Wherever there is a JD(S) candidate, the Congress vote will split and vice versa. That is likely to benefit the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),"" says Mahadev Prakash Shivanna, a Bengaluru-based political analyst.


A seat-sharing agreement has deepened the divide, especially in south Karnataka, where workers of the two parties can barely see eye-to-eye. Congress workers are refusing to work for the JD(S) candidate in Mandya, Nikhil Kumaraswamy, the son of H.D. Kumaraswamy, and are instead rallying behind independent Sumalatha Amarnath (Sumalatha Ambareesh), wife of Kannada actor M.H.Amarnath who died in November last year, who has the support of the BJP.

The state has had it rough in the last decade. It lost YSR in 2009 and was bifurcated into Telangana in 2014. There is anger against national parties for dividing the state. Telangana, the newest state, got a large share of resources and the state capital. The parent state was denied a special package by BJP, a key reason for Naidu to walk out of NDA. A “special status"" is thus on everybody’s lips in the state. Voters are also likely to confront political parties on two big issues facing the country—the lack of jobs and rural distress."

"The Sebi order did not go into whether any financial gain was made by the alleged misuse of the NSE data.


Among the multiple angles investigated by the stock market regulator in the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSE) co-location case, one pertains to the alleged misuse of exchange data for commercial gains.


In one of the five orders it put out after a four-year-long investigation, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said Ajay Shah, a senior academic with the government think-tank National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), along with his wife and sister-in-law, misused market data obtained from the NSE for commercial gains.


Sebi has held that Shah, along with his sister-in-law and an NSE official, “have collusively worked to fulfil their commercial goals by fraudulently using the data that was obtained by them from NSE to develop an algo trading software and products"". This trading software was used for sale to market participants for dealing in the securities market. Some of these products were allegedly used by firms for unfair access to NSE’s systems."

“We have seen a slowdown in the market in recent months,"" said the Britannia management in a press release. Analysts, however, point out that the company has gained market share from competitors such as Parle Products Pvt. Ltd in a declining market.


This has been aided by new launches, which have boosted sales. In the March quarter, the company launched Treat Burst, Treat Stars, Whole Wheat Marie and Milk Bikis Choco Cream.


“Britannia continues to gain market share in its core biscuits category, coupled with a stepped-up focus on building new categories,"" said analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 2 May.


But new launches also mean higher marketing expenses, which is why margins fell in the March quarter. “While new categories would aid topline growth in the near term, they would restrict margin expansion given investments needed in the scale-up,"" added the Jefferies India report."
"Pramod Kumar Ram, a senior RJD leader and state secretary from Gopalganj, recalls seeing Prasad for the first time during the Mandal agitation in the early 1990s in Patna. Ram describes how Prasad leapt out of a jeep on the way to Gandhi Maidan and dared security personnel to arrest him. “I was drawn by his fearlessness. Whenever he held a public meeting, people would cycle hours from villages to get a glimpse of him. He was chatty, engaging and funny at his meetings. He could remember people’s faces and names, and that really is the greatest quality of a leader,"" Ram said.


For two decades, RJD and its election symbol, the lantern, have been synonymous with Prasad. At rallies, his photographs form the backdrop and publicity material is replete with his words and pictures though he is not on the trail.


“Naturally, our party and its campaign would have been stronger (with his presence). Our opponents would have been weaker. He is a mass leader and his presence makes a difference. But still, if one goes out with the flag of Laluji’s party, people like you, and they stand up for you,"" Tejashwi Yadav, Prasad’s younger son, told Mint.


In an earlier interview, Tejashwi said, “Last time we met, seat-sharing talks were on. When we meet him in Ranchi, we talk about everything. We talk about home, we talk about politics. He gives advice.""


Early in April, Prasad wrote an open letter to his voters, which was released on his Twitter handle, from the hospital ward in Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi, where he has served eight months of his prison term. “Everything is at stake in this election - country, society, Lalu, who in other words gave you the aspiration to move about as equals with your heads held high and your rights, self-respect and dignity,"" he wrote.


The family is in touch with him regularly. “Every key decision—seat-sharing, choice of candidates, the party’s focus on reservation—is vetted by him,"" said a senior party member, requesting anonymity.


But giving advice from far cannot substitute being on the ground. “The organizing capacity that Lalu brought to the table is no longer there. In an earlier era, even in his absence, his party would draw unimaginable crowds, but now that is not happening. Even Yadav strongholds, like Patliputra, are beginning to show chinks in the armour,"" Ranjan said."

"As part of its strategy to take on competitors, Samsung had last year said it would introduce latest innovative features on its A series


BANGKOK: South Korean electronics major Samsung Wednesday unveiled the A80 model, the flagship of its A series mid-range mobile phones which are expected to play a key role in its efforts to wrest back lost market share from Chinese competitors in India.


As part of its strategy to take on competitors such as Xiaomi, Huawei and OnePlus, Samsung had last year said it would introduce latest innovative features on its A series of devices as well instead of just the top-end Note and S smartphone series.


The company is expected to launch in India the A70 model - which has already been globally unveiled soon - later this month, followed by the A80."

Uncertainties over US-China trade tensions and China's sluggish economy bode ill for global electronics makers in 2019, pressuring demand for memory chips, smartphones and display panels, analysts say.


But some investors are hoping for a recovery for Samsung in the second half, fuelled by chip sales to data centres, the rollout of 5G wireless technology and the launch of new gadgets including its long-promised, high-end foldable smartphone."
"Based on Monday’s share price, Jet Airways’ enterprise value (EV) works out to ?31,800 crore. This includes the present value of future rentals, using a rough capitalization factor of seven times rentals, and calculates market capitalization using an expanded equity base.

In comparison, the same measure for market leader InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, which runs IndiGo airlines, stood at 11.6 times. While there is no reason anyone would want to pay a premium over IndiGo to buy Jet Airways, perhaps a potential buyer may factor in possible cost savings, which result in a lower valuation multiple.


Besides, Jet Airways’ international slots are an attractive selling point. The big swing factor may well be the change in board composition, given that reports had earlier suggested interest from the Tata Group, with one of the conditions being full control."

Samsung plans to unveil the vertically folding phone late this year or early next year, and is using mock-ups to fine-tune the design, the people said. The gadget is designed with an extra screen on the outside, but the manufacturer may remove it depending on how customers respond to a similar display on the Galaxy Fold, they said.

The essence of the iPad will remain the same, albeit with a few changes, which have been long due now. The iPad might finally get FaceID, which means the omission of the iconic home button as well. As a result, the display can now stretch far more than the previous iterations. It will have the same firepower as the latest iPhones—an A12 bionic chipset.

"The Redmi Note 7 comes with a 6.3-inch LCD display with a resolution of 2340x1080. Xiaomi seems to take pride in the fact that the display of this smartphone has bezels up to 0.8mm thick. The display has an aspect ratio of 19.5:9 and has maximum brightness of 450nits.


Under the hood, the Redmi Note 7 is powered by Snapdragon 660 SoC paired with up to 6GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. It is backed by a 4,000mAh battery and supports QuickCharge 4. It ships with a 10W charger; although for even quicker charging, Xiaomi is also separately selling an 18W charger. External connectivity options include USB Type-C and a 3.5mm jack.


In terms of optics, the back of the Redmi Note 7 boasts a 48MP+5MP AI-enabled dual camera setup. It has a pixel size of 1.6 microns and an aperture of f/1.8. Thanks to the size of its sensor, the Note 7 promises good low light performance. The front of the smartphone sports a single 13MP selfie camera under the dew drop notch

"Clear History was first announced at last year’s F8, the company’s event for developers and partners, in response to an outcry about data collection and privacy lapses on its sites. The tool still hasn’t been launched, and it wasn’t mentioned Tuesday. Late last year, Facebook admitted that Clear History is taking longer than expected — it turns out that browsing data, which the company uses to help send more targeted advertising to users on its social platforms — is more deeply ingrained into Facebook’s systems than anyone realised. Simply finding and deleting the correct data without disrupting Facebook’s advertising and analytics businesses has been a big enough challenge that the product hasn’t gotten off the ground, although the company said earlier this month that the feature will debut this fall.


“It’s going to take time,"" Zuckerberg said of Facebook’s privacy-focused future. “I’m sure we’re going to keep on unearthing old issues for a while, so it may feel like we’re not making progress at first. But I think that we’ve shown, time and again as a company, that we can do what it takes to evolve and build the products that people want.""


To be sure, these are challenging problems to unravel. Facebook’s business was built on harvesting detailed user data to show people precisely targeted ads — not the kind of thing you simply undo overnight. Still, some privacy experts argue that the new announcements are little more than a veneer to assuage consumers, while changing little about its core business model.


“A lot of the focus is on changing the way that consumer-to-consumer interaction works,"" said Greg Sparrow, senior vice president and general manager at CompliancePoint, a data privacy and security consultancy. “While that is laudable and it’s great that they’re doing that, but fundamentally it doesn’t address the problem on the back-end side, which is businesses gaining access to this information and how they’re using it from a data monetisation perspective."""

A subsidiary of RPG Group, KEC International, is one of the leading engineering, procurement and construction companies in India. Its ability to estimate project cost at the time of bidding helped it win projects, deliver margins and mitigate risks. These estimates were based on the analysis of contour maps and physical surveys, which was both time-taking and prone to human errors. After trying out several alternatives, KEC decided to go with autonomous surveys using drones. Once the data was captured, it used image analytics, computer visions, and machine learning models to calculate excavation and backfilling of land. This allowed its bidding team to estimate project costs more accurately and this improved its bid-to-win ratio significantly. In terms of cost savings, the spending on excavation and backfilling quantity was reduced by up to 30%. Now KEC can survey 250 acres in five hours, which earlier took more than five days. This has also allowed it to build a repository of data in digital format for future use."

Looking ahead as technology progresses faster and faster, will human intelligence still be a useful resource? Will there really be enough work for humans to perform?


Some predict these technological trends to be catastrophic, culminating in mass unemployment. But our analysis suggest that the future of work can hold opportunity and the promise of more and better work—provided investment steps up, enabling growth in productivity, and the nation simultaneously gears up for workforce skill transitions.


First, it should be understood that not all human activities are easily automatable based on currently proven technologies. McKinsey Global Institute’s (MGI’s) analysis of more than 2,000 work activities across more than 800 occupations shows that automatable tasks include those done in predictable and structured environments, or involving routine data collection and data processing. But other activities will be much less susceptible to automation, such as managing teams, solving non-routine problems, and interfacing with stakeholders in unpredictable situations. Overall, about 30% of the time spent in most occupations could be technically automated—but in only about 5% of occupations are nearly all activities automatable. The pace at which automation will be adopted depends on several factors besides technical feasibility. Among these are the cost of technology deployment, workforce quality and wages, and the benefits of technology beyond reducing cost—for example, as a spur to innovation or quality.


Moreover, even as technology substitutes some forms of work, new types of work will be created—and this is not a new phenomenon. The introduction of the automobile created almost 7 million net new jobs in the US between 1910 and 1950, based on our estimates. It displaced workers who manufactured wagons, carriages, harnesses and saddles, as well as horse breeders and metal workers. But it created ten times as many jobs, in a host of new occupations: for workers in automotive supply chain, warehouses and logistics, auto dealerships, auto repair, gas stations, and convenience stores, amongst others."
"While the damages awarded Friday aren’t significant to either company, from Qualcomm’s perspective, valuing just three of its more than 10,000 patents at $1.41 per phone shows the overall worth of its inventions. About 1.4 billion smartphones were sold last year, according to IDC.


In the broader licensing fight, Qualcomm has lost billions of dollars in revenue after Apple, through its Asian manufacturers, stopped paying patent royalties in 2017. The companies had a falling out in 2016 when Qualcomm -- which had been the exclusive supplier of iPhone chipsets for five years -- halted quarterly royalty rebates it had been paying Apple. The chipmaker has said it ended the rebates because Apple instigated antitrust investigations of Qualcomm and lied to regulators.


Apple has switched to using Intel Inc. chips in its phones. The Cupertino, California-based company has accused Qualcomm of using its control over so-called standard essential patents, which covers technology uniformly adopted by telecommunications providers and equipment makers, to extract excessive royalties for the entire patent portfolio, including non-essential patents, that it licenses to smartphone makers."

"None of BJP’s top leaders, including Modi, have made any mention about the temple in public meetings ever since elections were announced on 10 March. While Modi held a public meeting in Gosaiganj near Ayodhya on Wednesday, his larger pitch was development. Like in 2014, in this election too, the BJP has reiterated its commitment in its national manifesto to ‘explore all possibilities’ within the Constitution to expedite the temple construction but it’s not talked about.


“Naturally, the city is inseparable from the issue of the land dispute but no one wants clashes. For us here, development is what concerns us. We want better roads, infrastructure and access to services, and that is the crucial issue in this election,"" said Ismail Mohammad, who owns a bangle shop in Ayodhya. “We’re still lagging behind on development.""

"New breed of hackers: Hacking as we knew it has changed. While in the beginning it was the handiwork of overenthusiastic individuals honing their cyber-skills by finding loopholes in live systems, hackers today are financially motivated and run their operations under the aegis of organized criminal organizations, according to the 2019 Security Report by Checkpoint Software Technologies Ltd, released this month. The hacker arrested by the US department of justice in September 2018 for the WannaCry ransomware attack of 2017, for instance, was part of a criminal organization called the Lazarus Group with alleged links to the North Korean government.


Further, with more businesses moving their operations online, vast amounts of financial and critical business-related data is now stored in data centres. For cybercriminals, this is a huge opportunity as they can not only break into company systems and steal data but can take control and lock out the owners of their own systems. For instance, the Petya ransomware, which affected 2,000 enterprises in 65 countries, had locked users out of their own systems.


Hackers know what to target: According to Checkpoint, more than 10,000 different malicious files are detected per day while 700 malware families are being used on a daily basis. Initially, most of the ransomware attacks such as WannaCry and Petya didn’t have any specific target. Cybercriminals have changed tactics and are now striking at their most vulnerable point of the target."

"Karnataka has a caste-centric political system with three major parties—BJP, Congress and JD(S). Voters tend to vote for a different party in the state and at the centre. While JD(S) has little presence outside the southern districts, BJP considers Mumbai-Karnataka and the coast its bastions. Though the Congress is the only party with a pan-Karnataka presence, its rocky equation with JD(S) could give BJP entry into regions in the south. The state is also divided based on regions. The south boasts of high industrial growth, better access to irrigation, IT and development, while the north has some of the most backward regions in India.


The Congress and JD(S) have a state-level alliance and are jointly contesting the Lok Sabha polls as well. JD(S) relies on votes from the Vokkaliga community, while BJP believes it enjoys the support of the upper caste Lingayats. The Congress depends on minorities and a fragmented support base of backward classes and scheduled castes. However, the Vokkaligas and Lingayats are still upset with former chief minister Siddaramaiah, which could swing votes away from the coalition. The Congress and JD(S) hold on to their almost captive caste groups and are willing to trade only if the gesture is mutual."

"That would mean a blotch on the central bank’s record of not keeping inflation at or above 2%, which is of course ironic for a country once threatened by high inflation. The MPC’s mandate is 2-6% inflation range, with 4% as the mid-point target to achieve on an enduring basis.


But what tilted the odds to the rate cut were inflationary expectations. Indians now expect inflation to be benign as the central bank’s survey of households revealed. Households’ expectations on inflation in the next three months have fallen by 80 basis points (bps) and for the next one year by 130 bps, said RBI. A basis point is 0.01%.


This is music to a central bank’s ears, siSarvesh Kumar Sharma/Mintnce monetary policy targets inflation expectations. The revision in the headline inflation forecast for the entire 2019 was a massive 60 bps, with RBI’s models forecasting that inflation would be at best 3.9% by the end of this year. That suggests a 4% target is already a checked box and RBI can afford to bring down cost of borrowing for individuals and companies.


“Now that the MPC has advanced the rate cut, the chances of another cut soon have increased; of course subject to the incoming prints of consumer price inflation, which will be a key factor to watch,"" adds IndusInd Bank’s Kapur."
"The Congress, on the other hand, is trying to reposition itself as the main opposition party, having suffered a humiliating rout in 2014. It is trying to bring some focus on plummeting farm incomes and the lack of employment opportunities for the youngsters joining the labour force . The party is hoping to leverage the deep disgruntlement among farmers (most of whom have seen their incomes stagnate) and unemployed youth. Unsurprisingly, its manifesto devotes the first chapter to jobs.


In reality, economic hardships have exacerbated over the past three years and both parties make extra efforts to appear sympathetic. Both are relying on their individual versions of social welfare schemes and safety nets to appeal to the voter. One welfare scheme—cash transfers—has caught the fancy of both parties, adding custom-built bells and whistles. A basic guaranteed income has been promised, with clear targeting.


This is where lines both diverge and converge, contradictory as it might sound. Both parties have avowedly different ideologies but seem to cohere to a broadly common economic programme which cedes primacy to the market and re-imagines an expanded role for India’s private sector alongside a shrinking role for the state.


The cash transfer scheme is a back-handed acknowledgement of failure to reform the economy, abolish poverty, reduce inequality or sort out the structural issues that keep the economy from achieving its full potential. Instead of fixing the deep-rooted troubles (such as eliminating entrenched vote banks that deny farmers their rightful income) and investing in robust primary education and healthcare infrastructure, both parties have opted for the easier route of throwing around somebody else’s money."

David Wood, futurist and part of the team that developed the Symbian operating system for mobile phones (discontinued in 2014), believes India has a great role to play in future technologies. In an interview, he explained the reason and also shared his thoughts on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) among other things. Edited excerpts:


India has great potential. First of all because it has got so many people and many are educated. India can lead the world in healthcare initiatives. Indians are not afraid to innovate and have some of the world-class healthcare facilities. Looking at the vast number of clever people who can take advantage of each other’s ideas, I think some of the great initiatives of the future will be born and developed here."

Kochikar: Think of games as a specialised vertical, who have their own senses about things — how to design a game, etc. By doing an Indie Games Accelerator, we bring in specialised experts who are game centric. We could have brought venture capitalists (to speak to the developers), but instead we brought in CEO’s of game companies, experts in game design, people who understand game performance etc.

"The Fourth Industrial Revolution (i4.0) could transform the way we live and work – presenting both opportunities and challenges. It could lead India into the arc of global progress; entrepreneurs, CEOs, leaders, and start-ups are rapidly adopting technologies involving AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), 3D-printing, advanced robotics and neuroscience.


In this context, it is gratifying that KPMG in India’s survey of Indian CEOs showed that more than 90% of them see technology disruption as more of an opportunity than a threat. This i4 openness is what makes India stand out as an emerging economy.


So what will the Fourth Industrial Revolution mean for India? Among the many important aspects of i4.0 is the confluence of interconnected technologies that enables new approaches to multiple issues such as energy access, food security and building efficiencies. Mobility is expected to witness exponential growth; a leading cab aggregator is already working on air taxis and drones are being used across industries to identify and monitor work. Such advanced tech interventions will enhance pan-industrial functioning and processes.


Gartner says a 30-fold increase in connected devices will “significantly alter how the supply chain operates. Global firms recognise IoT’s transformational role, particularly in manufacturing, retailing and service industries. IoT is set to revolutionise the supply chain with both operational efficiencies and revenue opportunities. The supply chain today is a way to gain an edge on competitors and build your own brand. Smart devices can therefore really make a difference in their ability to closely monitor and deal with more variables than ever."

Also, as compared to 2014, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka will have a greater significance for BJP and Congress in Elections 2019


MUMBAI: Mumbai: Lok Sabha Elections 2019, dates of which were announced Sunday, will be contested in territories that could be called the battleground states. These are not only states which choose themselves for their size and significance, such as Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, but also smaller ones that will play an outsized role.


The party or alliance that wins Elections 2019 is going to be determined by the states that are not necessarily big but which nevertheless can swing the outcome in terms of the arithmetic of alliances and the competing narratives that have dominated the post-2014 landscape, such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu and the northeastern states.


West Bengal too assumes a greater significance for Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the main challenger—the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)—this year than it did in 2014.


Essentially, the battleground states in Elections 2019 are those that are traditional powerhouses and also those that have come to hold the levers of power in the post-2014 scenario."

"Sebi held this view as the two brokerage firms indulged in the so-called illegal paired contracts on the NSEL trading platform, which violated the norms of the Forward Contract Regulation Act (FCRA) and the Maharashtra Public Interest Depositor (MPID) Act. That caused a serious ‘reputational’ risk for the firms, Sebi said.


NSEL was, in July 2013, NSEL was barred from launching any fresh contracts after it was found that it allowed paired contact on its platform, which were violating FCRA and the terms on which NSEL was granted registration as a spot exchange. As a result, the exchange was unable to meet its settlement obligations of around ?5,548 crore to nearly 13,000 investors .


Sebi, in the order, also held that brokers had a close association with NSEL and allowed themselves to “become a channel"" and an instrument for the exchange to promote paired contracts.


Given the close association of the firms to NSEL and the paired contracts, and the relatability of the same to the noticee, the serious adverse observations of the various courts and authorities seriously eroded the reputation and belief in competence, fairness, honesty, integrity and character of the firms, Buch said in the order."

One company that went unmentioned in the iPhone maker’s two hour presentation: Google, owner of Android, which powers about 85% of the latest smartphones.


At first blush, this seems like an injudicious omission by Apple. There’s a lot riding on the company’s new services, and its video subscription in particular. Apple said it plans to launch in more than 100 countries, and in most of those places Android is even more dominant. Not making an Android version of the TV app ignores on hundreds of millions of potential paying viewers, especially outside the US.


On closer inspection, though, Apple is making a calculated bet that it doesn’t need those Android phone users — or has other ways of reaching them that don’t require cosying up to arch-rival Google."

"On Wednesday, Cook announced a potential drop of 25% in sales in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan in the most recent quarter. A sharp falloff like that suggests that Chinese consumers are following a trend in other emerging markets like India and Indonesia, where consumers have long passed over iPhones for cheaper, almost-as-good devices from Apple’s competitors.


People aren’t buying iPhones like they used to. With smartphones now in nearly every pocket in the developed world, new customers are hard to come by. So Apple has increasingly relied on enticing existing customers to toss their old iPhones for faster, slimmer, pricier successors.


Cook said this week that customers are waiting longer to replace their iPhones, with many instead swapping in new batteries to extend their life. Apple fuelled that trend when it cut the price of battery swaps to $29 from $79 in response to revelations that its software slowed down iPhones with old batteries.


That presents a dilemma for Cook. Apple wants iPhones to be durable and long-lasting so consumers will see them as worthy investments. (Many now cost more than a refrigerator.) Apple also knows that the longer consumers use their iPhone, the more they pay for apps and Apple services, a rapidly growing and increasingly important part of Apple’s business.


Apple’s sophisticated supply chain is among the great wonders of modern business, incorporating hundreds of suppliers in a complex web of factories and shippers to keep up with global demand for one of history’s most popular products. And Cook, who was Apple’s operations guru before he became chief executive, is largely credited with its creation.


But it soon might be in Trump’s cross hairs. Apple, one of the quintessential American brands, assembles most of its products in China — and Trump has noticed. He criticized Apple on the campaign trail, saying he’d force it to start making its products closer to home. While president, he has said Apple plans “to build a lot of plants"" in the United States — even though it hasn’t announced plans to do so. (Cook hasn’t publicly corrected him.)


While Apple avoided an iPhone tax in the first rounds of tariffs, it might not be so lucky if Trump is looking for more products to target. If that happens, Apple will be in a pickle. Its supply chain is entrenched in China, and finding another country that can match China’s scale and skill in the labour market will be difficult. The iPhone is also already among the world’s most expensive phones. Increasing the price to pay for tariffs would most likely scare away even more buyers."
"Within five years, for instance, scientists expect to be able to electronically record the brain signals that build memories and then enhance or even rewrite them before putting them back into the brain.


A decade from now, the first commercial memory boosting implants could appear on the market and, within 20 years or so, the technology could be advanced enough to allow for extensive control over memories, according to the researchers.


Scientists such as Ken Hayworth, a cognitive neuroscientist and president of Brain Preservation Foundation (brainpreservation.org), are not only trying to understand the brain but also preserve it for posterity and eventually upload a human mind into a machine if a human being so desires."
"“It just absolutely baffles me that if I wanted to completely get rid of Facebook that it essentially would still be on my phone, which brings up more questions,"" Winke said in an interview. “Can they still track your information, your location, or whatever else they do? We the consumer should have say in what we want and don’t want on our products.""


Consumers have become more alert about their digital rights and more vigilant about privacy in the past year, following revelations about Facebook’s information-sharing practices and regulators’ heightened scrutiny of online data collection. Some people have deleted their Facebook accounts in protest of the company’s lapses, while others simply want to make sure they have the option to do so. Many Android phone users have begun to question Samsung’s deal to sell phones with a permanent version of Facebook -- and some of them are complaining on social media.


A Facebook spokesperson said the disabled version of the app acts like it’s been deleted, so it doesn’t continue collecting data or sending information back to Facebook. But there’s rarely communication with the consumer about the process. The Menlo Park, California-based company said whether the app is deletable or not depends on various pre-install deals Facebook has made with phone manufacturers, operating systems and mobile operators around the world over the years, including Samsung. Facebook, the world’s largest social network, wouldn’t disclose the financial nature of the agreements, but said they’re meant to give the consumer “the best"" phone experience right after opening the box.


Balwinder Singh’s experience wasn’t what he would consider the best. Singh, who lives in the Susquehanna Valley of the eastern US and works in transportation, bought his Samsung phone seven months ago. He first tried to delete the Facebook app when he was setting up the device.


“My news feed was full of negative stuff, people going crazy on social media,"" he said. “It was affecting me emotionally and mentally."" Even after disabling the app, he was bothered to still have it on his phone."

"The new iPad Air has a few main changes—a newer and faster processor, support for the Apple Pencil and a slightly larger screen


While support for the Apple Pencil makes it better suited to a particular niche of creators, it’s worth noting that the new Air supports Apple’s first generation Pencil


It’s been about two years since Apple upgraded its iPad Air line. The company stopped selling the Air 2 sometime in 2017, making the 2019 iPad Air the third in this range.


It makes sense, too, since Apple was pushing the iPad Pro, a more creator-centric device, meant to replace laptops. As similar as the new iPad Air and iPad Pro are, it’s clear that the latter is meant to be a Microsoft Surface-like device, while the former is a tablet first.

"Samsung forecasts production of at least 1 million foldable phones this year. The launch of the device comes as the world’s biggest phone maker tries to lure back consumers who have become used to incremental upgrades and are being wooed by Chinese manufacturers’ lower-priced smartphones.


Samsung, which also produces memory chips and televisions, makes the foldable displays itself and supplies technology to rivals such as Apple. The South Korean company shipped 291.3 million phones last year while Huawei sold 205.8 million, according to Strategy Analytics. Samsung will probably sell more than 40 million units of its flagship Galaxy S10 in the first year of release, according to Counterpoint.


Samsung spent eight years developing the Galaxy Fold and has worked with Google to adapt the Android operating system for a foldable screen. The company also envisions smartphones with rollable and stretchable displays in the future, Samsung Executive Vice President Chung Eui-suk said on the corporate website last month."

"Call it development—an election battle cry first popularized way back in the 1990s by Gadkari, then a member of state legislative council who was so obsessed with flyovers that he would go on to build 50-plus of them in Mumbai alone when he became the public works minister in the Shiv Sena-BJP government in 1995. Now he’s joined in by Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, a local lad who is fast emerging as a new power centre in the post-2014 growth story of the BJP and the Sangh Parivar. Gadkari, once his mentor, is today seeing a new challenge in Fadnavis.


New Nagpur with all its good and bad bears a Gadkari-Fadnavis signature, a marked departure from the waves of transformations of the past. The plan, according to the Nagpur Metro Rail Corporation Ltd, is to build big towers along the metro routes by giving higher floor space index (FSI), and in return increasing the resources from the real estate 500 metres on either side of the metro corridor.


Nagpurians doubt if we could ever bring in such businesses, though an Oxford Economics report pitted Nagpur to be among the 20 fastest growing cities in the world from 2019-35. Nagpur is an education and a medical hub; an economy driven by services, small enterprise and trading, and regional government offices.


It began with a handful of few young men. In the dusty by-lanes of Mahal, the old town, Keshav Baliram Hedgewar formed a small group of swayamsevaks (volunteers) who would build one of India’s biggest socio-cultural and political organizations, the RSS—the right wing behemoth that reigns over the country today through its political arm, the BJP. For decades, while the RSS shakhas proliferated across the city, its political arm, the Jan Sangh and later the BJP, remained on the fringes.


“The Sangh is not a political organization, it is an organization of the entire Hindu society, and the society is a complex function,"" veteran Sangh ideologue M.G. alias Baburao Vaidya says. “The RSS volunteers gradually entered into many domains of the society, including politics, so if your gauge is only politics, you will falter in understanding the Sangh,"" he says at his modest house. “It’s the soul."" Vaidya, who started as a volunteer early on in his life, has seen both, Nagpur and the RSS expand over time. At 96, he has limited mobility, but is still sharp with his memory.


Notwithstanding a stern opposition to their ideology in the early part of the Sangh journey, it was the ideologues and volunteers like Vaidya, who steadfastly worked for its propagation. Today’s BJP and the RSS is the creation of that unflinching foundational work, he suggests.


“Some people started working on students’ issues, others entered politics, some others started working in the field of religion to form the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), late Dattopant Thengadi formed a trade union and a farmers’ organization; Ekal Vidyalaya got started in remote parts, there is one organization that works among the lawyers, other on culture,"" he says. “Today there are about 36 such entities that work in different spheres but because politics gains prominence the BJP gets the limelight.""


The RSS’ phenomenal expansion and its volunteers’ steadfast loyalty helps the BJP and its leaders, he says. Nagpur too, isn’t an exception. The country-wide rise of the BJP and the Sangh Parivar and the waning of the Congress and its moral compass has altered even Nagpur’s political landscape.


If the RSS was formed here, Nagpur was also where Dr B.R. Ambedkar embraced Buddhism along with thousands of his Scheduled Caste supporters at Deekshabhoomi in what remains the only democratic example of a bloodless conversion, a revolution against caste discrimination that continues to hold promise of an equal society for all those who experienced untouchability. It was a thought that revolted against the RSS’ idea of Hindutva. Much of Maharashtra’s Scheduled Caste intellectual movement got traction from here. It still remains the epicentre of the Ambedkarite movement on the one hand and RSS on the other. Historically and ontologically, the two thoughts remain antithetical to each other.


“Nagpur always had staunch left, right and centrist movements, but never had animosities between them,"" remembers N.D. Khare, author and proprietor of one of the region’s oldest construction firms. “There was always a bonhomie between various thinkers, something that we have lost today."" Nagpur took pride in towering and erudite academicians, painters and musicians, and of course poets and writers. Suresh Bhat, Manik Godghate alias Grace, Mahesh Elkunchwar… the list is long.


Politically, despite being the RSS headquarter and epicentre of Ambedkar’s Republican movement, Nagpur always remained centrist and deeply secular—a character that is perceptibly changing. In this context, 2019 has much at stake for Nagpur.


Will Nitin Jairam Gadkari defy history to win a second term from Nagpur as a Lok Sabha member? Nagpur goes to polls in the first phase. Over 2.1 million voters will cast their vote on 11 April. He has huge personal stakes in the coming general elections. Some of his ideas are untested. Some of his pet-projects are half way through. And there’s a protégé who’s quietly turned a challenger."

"But an analysis of the companies shows startups working on truly innovative problems constitute less than a tenth of these companies.


Most of the funds (and noise) is soaked up by startups engaged in one of two things. The first, on-demand and e-commerce platforms, find new ways to order things without leaving your couch. The other class of startups, social media and entertainment firms, are focused on designing content that keeps you in that couch for as long as possible.


Take on-demand firms. Uber has improved the taxi-hailing experience; WeWork has made renting office space easy; and with Swiggy, it’s nice not to have to walk to the restaurant for food. But we are still riding in the same taxi, working in the same office, and eating from the same restaurant as before. The order-to-fulfilment process has been streamlined and the supply more closely matches demand. But this isn’t innovation that has fundamentally altered how we live, work, or play. It’s just made it incrementally better.


The desire to disrupt any activity with on-demand or online substitutes can sometimes veer into the absurd. Early last year, SoftBank’s Vision Fund invested $300 million into Wag, a startup that lets you book a dog walker. (The Vision Fund’s stated goal is to “invest in businesses and foundational platforms that will enable the next age of innovation"".)


With social media companies, the innovation argument is even weaker. Facebook and Google evangelised the cult of connectivity. But after the initial productivity gains from improved communication, watching YouTube videos, sharing Google photos or browsing Facebook are not growth-accelerating. On the contrary, the fatigue induced by aimless scrolling on Twitter or WhatsApp are a drain on productivity.


For an industry that fetishizes disruption and innovation, this lack of creativity is disappointing. One reason for this state of affairs could be financial. The computer scientist Jaron Lanier has argued that the monetization model driving the internet has created perverse incentives for tech companies.


From the early days of the internet, we assumed that most of the content and services should be free. But the desire to democratize access to information came at a cost —the advertising-supported business model. The largest tech companies today—Facebook and Google—rely on advertising for a majority of their revenue. Even Amazon has now got into the game, by selling pixels on its site to eager sellers.


In the push to generate more advertising revenue, these companies need to continually find ways to keep users addicted (or engaged) to their platform. And as users have become smarter, the algorithms have become even more intricate.


Today, some of the largest employers of A.I. and machine-learning talent are social media platforms. ByteDance, the creator of Tik Tok and the most valuable startup on the planet, employs legions of AI and machine-learning engineers. Tik Tok does a great job of curating and customizing content, based on what’s most likely to appeal to a user. But peel away the glamour and the product is still a social network for amateur music videos."

"Ever since Gandhi’s candidacy was announced, money, attention and flow of volunteers has increased from the Left, according to the local CPM insiders Mint spoke to, on condition of anonymity. Being a cadre party, the CPM’s ground machinery is known to have toppled elections in the past.

Of these, 29 saw intra-day movements of 20-30%. Five stocks moved between 30% and 40% and six moved more than 40%.


One solution proposed by Sebi is introducing a 20% price band for all stocks including ones on which derivatives are available. However, this could pose difficulties as F&O stocks have enhanced eligibility criteria.


Another way is to use a mix of dynamic and fixed price bands. “The current framework for dynamic price band may be allowed to continue with the initial threshold set by the stock exchanges,"" said the paper. However, this framework would be available up to a threshold of 30% of intraday movement, after which a fixed price band on the stock may be imposed or a call auction held for a fixed duration, Sebi said."

"Whatever federal privacy law eventually emerges is expected to be less stringent than the California measure and to supersede it. As a result, the tech industry is trying to help shape any national restrictions.


""This is the first time ever that the industry wants legislation,"" said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy advocacy group. ""The industry is terrified.""


On Tuesday, a House committee will press Google and Facebook executives about another urgent concern involving Big Tech: Whether they're doing enough to curb the spread of hate crimes and white nationalism through online platforms. The Judiciary Committee hearing follows a series of violent incidents fueled in part by online communication.


Facebook, used by 2-billion-plus people including over 200 million in the US, has been a particular lightning rod for industry critics. Having had its reputation tarnished over data privacy lapses, a tide of hate speech and a spread of disinformation that allowed Russian agents to target propaganda campaigns, Facebook appears ready to embrace a national privacy law.


Facebook's founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, published a column last month in the Washington Post calling for tighter regulations to protect consumer data, control harmful content and ensure election integrity and data portability.


Amazon says it has built its business on protecting people's information, ""and we have been working with policymakers on how best to do that.""


""There is real momentum to develop baseline rules of the road for data protection,"" Google's chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, has said in a policy paper. ""Google welcomes this and supports comprehensive, baseline privacy regulation.""


A sweeping ""privacy shield"" law in the European Union, covering how tech companies handle personal data in the 28-country bloc, should be a model, Zuckerberg wrote. EU regulators recently fined Google $1.7 billion for freezing out rivals in the online ad business — their third penalty against the search giant in two years.

"Kaspersky Labs has also been on the trail of a cyber espionage operation run by an Arabic speaking cyber crime organisation, Gaza Cybergang. Known as SneakyPastes, the operation used malicious emails and domains to carry out phishing attacks against 240 high-profile individuals in embassies, media houses, political parties, government agencies and banks in 39 countries. However, most of them were located in Palestine, Jordan, Israel and Lebanon.


The researchers identified three different groups within the organisation with each showing a slightly different MO. SneakyPastes was the handiwork of one such sub-group called Mole Rats.


To avoid detection and hide the location of the command and control server, the hackers would download an additional malware on the targeted devices via free sites, including Pastebin and Github. In the final stage, a Remote Access Trojan was installed on the device, which opened a backdoor with their command and control server to steal, encrypt and upload information from the targeted device."
"“I am blown away,"" said Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy, adding that the phone could help Samsung rejuvenate its mobile business, whose lead is under attack from China’s Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.


“I believe you can innovate your way out of a mature market,"" he said, noting that when Apple launched the iPhone in 2007, most industry watchers believed that the market had matured for $100 “candy bar"" phones without touchscreens.


Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research said that the work Samsung had done with Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. to adapt applications to the new screen was important.


He said that though Samsung had teased the folding phone before, “to see it in action, to see the software—I was like, wow. It’s hugely important that the software experience be good"".


The Galaxy Fold, which can operate three apps simultaneously and boasts six cameras, also challenges the notion of what a phone can cost, debuting at nearly twice the price of current top-of-the-line models from Apple and Samsung itself.


“Due to price, it’s likely to be sold mainly to early adopters. Prices are key to expanding sales,"" said former Samsung mobile executive Kim Yong-serk, who is now a professor at Sungkyunkwan University in Korea. “It will help Samsung burnish an image as an innovative company, but it is unlikely to be profitable. I expect Apple to wait say for one year and come up with foldable phones with more features, as they did with the smartwatch."""

"Facebook accepted the mistake but said the passwords were never visible to anyone outside of Facebook. Users can check which of their accounts or passwords have been compromised on sites like haveibeenpwned.com, created by Hunt.


Google recently added a password checkup extension for Chrome, which can tell which will tell users which of their usernames and passwords have been compromised and need to be changed.


Two-factor authentication has emerged as the second line of defence to passwords. After punching in their password, users are required to verify the sign in process using one-time password (OTP) sent through SMS, a six-digit code generated through apps like Google Authenticator, or through a small USB device like Google Titan Security Key or Yubico FIDO U2F Security key. This last step requires users to plug in the USB dongle into the PC and then type the specific code only they would know. For smartphones there are Bluetooth based Security keys."
"Maintaining a strong password is not a single step solution. Users need to keep various things in mind to keep passwords strong.


According to McAfee Labs, in addition to using long and complex passwords comprising a random set of symbols, numbers and letters, specific to each account, users also need to keep security software up to date to avoid keylogger attacks, avoid signing into accounts on public computers or on their personal devices using public WiFi. A keylogger is malicious software that can track your keystrokes.


Complex passwords can be hard to remember. This is where password managers like LastPass and Keeper can come in handy. These solutions keep all complex passwords in an encrypted format and users can access them all with one master password. Besides the master password, some of the solutions use multi-factor authentication and sign-in forms.


While users should regularly update their passwords, keeping an eye on the passwords that might have been compromised in a data breach might help too. In March, Faceboook was accused by an independent cybersecurity expert for storing millions of passwords in plain text format on its internal servers. These passwords could be seen by anyone with access to these servers."

You may have heard of reverse brain drain. From the looks of it, it may well be time for a reversal in the nature of capital flows as well.

And while there have been provisions for Indian investors to invest in assets of developed markets, hardly anyone has taken advantage of those opportunities.

New Delhi: A relatively-unknown US-based display manufacturer, Royole Corporation, founded by Stanford engineering graduates in 2012 beat giants like Samsung to the pole when it announced the world’s first foldable smartphone, called the FlexPai, on Sunday.


The smartphone, which folds outwards from the middle, offers a 7.8-inch screen when open, which can be used as one large screen (aka a tablet) or two separate screens running two different tasks side-by-side. When folded, only one of the screen’s sides remains active, giving you a 4-inch display."
"However, you need good headphones (though it covers impedance as low as 8 ohm), a well-tuned ear and good music files to really take advantage of this.

You will likely feel this if you’re a bass-head and want more powerful, booming bass. That’s where the M0 is slightly weak, in terms of audio quality. Highs and mids sound quite sharp.


To conclude, the Shanling M0 is certainly a product some would consider buying. However, in the larger portable media player market, it is an entry level device. That, at a price of around ?10,000 may be difficult to justify.


Moreover, the true audiophile market will probably prefer something better (even if they are more expensive), like the Fiio M7 or the more premiumly priced ones by Astell & Kern and Sony."

The cloud-based platform has also tied up with CBSE to provide digital versions of marksheets of students. Subscribers can also integrate their permanent account number (PAN) with DigiLocker. Banks like Kotak Bank and ICICI Bank, too, have integrated their retail internet banking platforms with the platform.


However, like most Digital India apps, DigiLocker is a work in progress. While it has made it easier for users to carry their educational certificates, birth certificates, insurance documents, driving licences and produce them on demand, the app’s user experience has been wanting in several areas.


Prasanto K. Roy, a technology policy consultant, who has the app installed with his Aadhaar, driving license and a couple of other government documents, feels many government apps are really basic and utilitarian, with little focus on user experience (UX), and inadequate testing and feedback.


“The DigiLocker app’s UX needs more work. For instance, the repeated re-entry of the PIN when you switch from one view or document to the other is pointless—good UX would simply require a timeout for PIN re-entry, or allow me to change the setting,"" he cited as an example."

New Delhi: In the summer of 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) staked claim to form a government in Delhi by sweeping India's Hindi heartland. The party won nearly 90% of its seats from just five states in north and central India. Five years down the line, the Congress has swept back to power in assembly elections held in several of those states. The BJP has also witnessed a reversal in vote share in state legislative seats which fall within parliamentary constituencies the party won for the first time ever in 2014.

"Under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a landmark privacy law adopted last year, individuals have the right to get a copy of their data held by internet companies, or ask that it be deleted.


But the legislation is no help in inheritance matters, as it applies only to the living, bequeathing no rights to their heirs, said Rowenna Fielding, a data protection expert at British consultancy Protecture.

'Demonetisation might not suit political arithmetic... We did it for national interest, not for political gains,' says PM Narendra Modi


On jobs front, PM Narendra Modi says India could not have notched up its fast pace of GDP growth without employment generation


New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday made a strong defence of his government’s controversial move to demonetise high-value currencies and its record in job creation. Demonetisation, he said in a wide-ranging interview with Hindustan, was launched in “national interest, not for political gain"". On the jobs front, Modi said India could not have notched up its fast pace of GDP growth without employment generation and that 60 million jobs have been created in micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) alone in the last four years. Edited excerpts:


It had been a very satisfactory and extremely good five years. My experience in these five years boosted my belief that there is no reason why India should remain in the category of developing countries.


We have all the capabilities to be a developed country. This conviction will continue to be of great help to take the country ahead in the next five years.


When I came here, the situation was much worse than what I have thought it would be. It was a terrible situation. I was new to this place and I also had to understand issues, but as we started taking decisions, several worrying things came up.


My long experience as chief minister helped me to remain confident, and I knew that we would find ways, and we did find ways.


It would be difficult to restrict myself to this. Earlier, the government would beat its own drum throughout the year over one or two achievements. My case is such that if you take any ministry, any state or any development work, you can see a new initiative in it. There would've hardly been a day in these five years when an important decision was not taken or important work was not done.


So, there are so many achievements and initiatives, that to confine it to just three would be an injustice to other departments and my colleagues.


You made some promises when you assumed charge. Now that your first term is coming to an end, do you think you have not been able to complete the work you set out to?


If everything gets completed then I think that the world will come to a halt. One should look for new energy, ambitions and resolutions to move in life. The biggest satisfaction I get from my work is that it fuels my ambitions further to do many more new things.


You launched social schemes, such as 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao', 'Jan Dhan Yojana', 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan' and the Mudra Scheme. You have spoken about social development in a committed manner. Are you happy with the results?


The train of India’s development runs on two tracks. One is the social infrastructure. Another, the physical infrastructure.


Keeping in mind the poorest of the poor, we must reach that social infrastructure level where everyone has house, education, health and toilet. Physical infrastructure should be world-class.


Look at the time of the independence struggle. The country was under occupation for many years. Every part of the country made sacrifices, but what did Gandhiji do? He changed the independence struggle into people’s movement: you take the broomsticks for independence, spin cotton for independence, you give adult education for independence, you teach for the purpose of independence. He added people’s participation to the freedom movement and changed the latter’s face.


I believe that development, like freedom struggle, should also be a people’s movement. We had previously considered limited programmes as adequate development, and this, I believe, used to be our strategic shortsightedness. If we had turned it into people’s movement, the results would have been hundred-fold.


I'm sure you know that when there was lesser number of currency notes with highest denomination of ?100 in India, Indira Gandhi had come up with a proposal (to demonetise). According to a book, Yashwantrao Chavan told her, “Do you want to do politics or not? Do you want to fight elections or not? Don’t fall in this trap.""


So, demonetisation might not have suit political arithmetic but for the national interest it had to be done. We did it for national interest, not for political gains.


Our steps against black money in the last four-and-a-half years have resulted in recovery of ?130,000 crore, which has been taxed and awarded penalties. Properties worth ?50,000 crores have been seized. During this period, ?6,900 crore of benami properties and assets in foreign shores worth ?1,600 crore have been also seized.


Nearly 338,000 shell companies have been identified and deregistered. Their directors have been disqualified. It’s also due to demonetisation that tax compliance has almost doubled.


They (the opposition parties) did it earlier too. This did a lot of campaign in UP but they lost very badly. They got defeated over all the issues they tried to take to the people. It would have been a different thing if they had shown honesty and did some research.


You tell me, there were three lakh shell companies. Four hundred companies were running in such a small room (stretches his hand to show the size), hawala trade was going on...


Demonetisation had an impact on the hawala trade and terrorism. NIA investigations in Jammu and Kashmir showed that future funding for terror activities were cut off.


One of the criticisms often voiced is that demonetisation impacted employment. What is it that the government is doing on employment generation?


First of all, we have to understand the way employment data is collected in our country. For many years, we have been doing a sample survey and, on its basis, a minimum assumption is made. Let’s look at some facts—this may or may not suit some people."

"Spotify Technology SA and other technology giants appealed a ruling that increased the royalties they must pay to songwriters, a move that threatens to further damage the companies’ already-tenuous relationship with the music industry.


Songwriters celebrated last year when the Copyright Royalty Board ruled that they will get at least a 15.1% share of streaming revenues over the next five years, a raise from the previous rate of 10.5%. The bump, which came in January 2018, was the biggest ever, the National Music Publishers Association said at the time.


But music-streaming services, most of which are either lose money or only eke out a small profit, warned the change would make it harder to operate. They also complain that the ruling was made without enough input from them."

Discoms is short for electricity distribution companies.


This can bring material relief for listed power firms. CESC Ltd, JSW Energy Ltd, Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL), and Adani Power Ltd have power plants that do not have sufficient PPAs. In most cases, power plants are losing money due to under-utilization. If these plants achieve break-even levels, it will reduce the burden on the parent companies."
"“One of the main issues is the citizenship amendment bill, which was passed in the Lok Sabha. It will again come back,"" said Congress’ Chishi. Political parties from the North-East believe that the bill was at cross purposes with the National Register of Citizens, which seeks to wean out illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. “Further, the BJP government wants to introduce a uniform civil code. It is dangerous. Once it is enshrined in the Constitution, the special protection to Nagas that Article 371 (A) provides will go. During British rule, the Naga hills under Assam were left as an excluded area. They wanted Nagas to remain on their own, without interference. They didn’t want outsiders to dilute the Naga way of life.""


Few in the clergy in the Christian-majority state have backed the Congress, while terming BJP as anti-secular. Warning against the BJP for its support to a uniform civil code, the anti-conversion bill and the citizenship bill, they ask Nagas—in WhatsApp messages and forwards—to be bold “in faith, not in money"".

"The 2019 Lok Sabha elections in Tamil Nadu will be the first since independence not to feature a larger-than-life figure. It will also be a litmus test for AIADMK and DMK after the deaths of their biggest leaders—J. Jayalalithaa and M. Karunanidhi. Mint analyses the electoral dynamics of the state.


Tamil Nadu, where politics and cinema have been intertwined for long, will see a four-cornered fight between the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA); the DMK-Congress alliance; Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam and T.T.V Dinakaran’s Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam, a breakaway faction of AIADMK. NDA includes the BJP, Pattali Makkal Katchi, Vijaya-kanth’s Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam and three small parties. Left parties, Vaiko’s Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and the Indian Union Muslim League are with the Congress and DMK."
"In 2014, BJP swept Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh. It retained Gujarat in the 2017 assembly elections, despite a spirited Congress performance. The Congress focus had shifted to the three other states that then were held by the BJP: Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh, allowing the BJP to regroup in Gujarat.


A resurgent Congress that won these three states in 2018 remains a challenge for the BJP in Elections 2019. This also holds true for other Hindi-speaking states, where the BJP made big gains in 2014 but anti-incumbency could play a role in 2019.


The Congress, meanwhile, will look to do better than it did in 2014—buoyed by its performance in the 2018 state elections.


As compared to 2014, a few southern states have a greater significance for the BJP and the Congress in Elections 2019. In Tamil Nadu, both the national parties have tied up with the two Dravidian regional powers. Kerala, the epicentre state of the Left vs Sangh battle, will witness another BJP bid, this time powered by the Sabarimala controversy, to not only retain the lone seat it won in 2014 but also make additional gains.


The Congress and Janata Dal (Secular), or JDS, which formed a post-poll alliance in Karnataka in 2018, will look to make Karnataka a test case for the opposition alliance. In 2014, the Congress won 10 Lok Sabha seats, the JDS 2 and the BJP 15.


For the BJP, the 2018 Karnataka elections—when it emerged as the single-largest party—may not really be the sole determinant of its 2019 show."

"Only certain Apple Watch models support cellular calls, but those that don’t can still make emergency calls when near a paired iPhone or Wi-Fi service.


Apple says it monitored some 2,500 people — measuring how they fell off ladders, missed a step while walking or got their legs caught in their pants while getting dressed. It used that data to separate real falls from other heavy wrist movements, such as clapping and hammering.


The feature will turn on automatically for users 65 and over; younger people can activate it in the settings. “I can see kids buying one for their parents and grandparents,"" said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights.


But the Apple Watch still lacks one feature found in rival wrist gadgets: the ability to analyse sleep quality. Battery life in the new watch remains at 18 hours, meaning it needs a daily — or nightly — recharge.

Almost three in four banks in Asia Pacific anticipate that fraud in their country will increase in 2019, said a new report by FICO on Tuesday. Of specific concern are transactions completed when neither the card nor the cardholder is physically present (card-not-present or CNP fraud), as well as cards taken out by criminals under false identities (application fraud), the report added.


Cybersecurity continues to be a major issue in India with 76.3% of organizations hit by cyber attacks in the last year, as compared to 68% organizations hit across the globe, a global survey from security firm Sophos corroborated. The report found that on an average, Indian organizations that investigate one or more potential security incidents each month spend 48 days a year (four days a month) investigating them.


On 13 March, security firm Seqrite--the enterprise arm of Quick Heal Technologies--said that in the second half of 2018, it detected close to 50 million threats targeting enterprises. This translates to around 186 detections every minute. These detections included known and unknown threats such as cryptojacking, ransomware, trojans, exploits, worms, infectors, potentially unwanted applications (PUAs), and adware. Further, commercial spyware programs called 'Stalkerware' are background-running apps installed on phones, which can be used to monitor and track device activity."

"As far as Assam is concerned, the important ally, the AGP, did a flip-flop of walking out of the BJP on the CAB issue and then walking right back into the arms of the BJP. The AGP’s image as a regional party which nurtured aspirations of the Assamese people after the anti-Bengali, anti-illegal immigrant movements of the late 1970s-80s has taken a huge beating. It is seen as an opportunistic party. It is unlikely that the AGP will win any of the 14 seats this time.


Understandably, the BJP has put up candidates in 13 out of 14 Lok Sabha seats. The party in its no-nonsense approach has axed five sitting MPs. Guwahati MP Bijoya Chakraborty’s name has been set aside on account of her age (she is now 79 years), while sitting MPs Kamakhya Prasad Tasa and Ramen Deka have been dropped due to poor performance. Tezpur MP Ram Prasad Sarmah was axed after his name cropped up in the cash-for-jobs scam in which one of his daughters was involved. Sarmah had allegedly bribed the chairman of the Assam Public Service Commission along with many others to get his daughter selected in the Assam Police Service. Certainly, the BJP would not even touch Sarmah with a barge pole. The party seems serious about keeping its slate clean. Hence, Rajen Gohain, minister of state for railways who is allegedly involved in a case of rape and molestation has also been axed. Gohain tried to push his wife’s name but to no avail. It appears that the BJP will also not entertain dynastic politics in the region.


In the lone seat from Nagaland, the ruling People’s Democratic Alliance consensus candidate and NDPP party nominee, Tokheho Yepthomi, and Congress candidate K.L. Chishi, a former chief minister, are the two serious contenders. Political analysts are of the view that the sitting MP Yepthomi will return considering he has the support of Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio and the BJP. Also, NDPP’s bitter rival, the NPF, has not put up any candidate. Neither has the BJP which knows that it has to ride on its alliance partner, the NDPP.


As far as Manipur is concerned, the two Lok Sabha seats of Outer and Inner Manipur will see a fight between the BJP candidates and the main rival, the Congress. Earlier, both seats were held by the Congress. This time, the Congress has fielded two new faces—O. Nabakishore Singh, former chief secretary of the state, and K. James, an entrepreneur. The party has dropped both sitting MPs. The BJP is fielding the party’s state unit spokesperson R.K. Ranjan and party’s state unit vice- president H. Shokhopao alias Benjamin Mate as candidates.


Interestingly, the NPP and the NPF, which are allies of the BJP in Manipur are both fielding candidates. This weakens the case of the BJP candidates since votes can get fragmented even while the Congress vote bank remains intact."

"The global consensus among experts is that 5G will truly become mainstream in 2020. But if that is to actually happen, 2019 will perhaps be the most crucial year for the next generation of wireless broadband technology. Companies like Ericsson have already started bringing their 5G products to India.


Moreover, while network equipment makers have been ready for a while, device makers are now pushing through. This month, Qualcomm unveiled its new mobile chipset, the Snapdragon 855, which will support 5G connectivity on mobile phones.


Edge Computing relates to both 5G and IoT. While 5G lowers the latency in networks, meaning data can travel faster between the servers and devices, edge computing takes care of the processing needs. This technology allows data to be processed closer to the source device, thereby making it easier for IoT devices to work on the fly.


Experts expect 2019 to have realistic implementations of smart cities, driverless cars and more—all of which requires edge computing. As 5G improves the network, edge computing is expected to augment the value that 5G brings.


Companies like IBM and D-Wave have broken ground in this field. IBM now has a a 50-qubit quantum computer. D-Wave’s machine—with its 2000 qubits—does not qualify to be a ‘true’ quantum computer, mostly because its qubits are not built like those in traditional quantum computers, argue critics. Meanwhile, even Google, Microsoft and Intel have been working for quantum supremacy. This is a technology that will gain more maturity in 2019.

We have to see whether we can mirror that data and transport it to another jurisdiction, or whether we can create metadata and transport data, or transport non-critical data.

"Samsung was pushing to be the first to roll out flexible phones to the masses with pre-orders for the Fold — which sports a 7.3-inch screen when laid flat like a tablet — starting in mid-April. That would put it comfortably ahead of rivals, with Huawei planning a bendable-screen release as early as June while Xiaomi only unveiled its foldable prototypes earlier this year.


The Fold had began as a mere display panel project at Samsung. Considered a second-tier TV manufacturer until the 1990s, it rapidly evolved and began to challenge Apple in high-end smartphones around 2010. Yet it continued to battle perceptions of being a “fast adopter"" rather than a true innovator: Apple sued Samsung in 2011 for “slavishly"" copying the iPhone’s design, triggering a years-long legal battle.


It was around then that Samsung decided to draw on its decades-long prowess in screen technology to build an indisputably original product, and set itself apart. A phone that also unfolds into a tablet could open up a brand new market.


Initial prototypes would crack like a dried sheet of paper if folded about 10,000 times, people familiar with the matter said. Still, Samsung recognized its potential. It started to recruit mechanical engineers who could devote themselves to building a hinge the size of a finger, after the company realized the key to preventing cracks was to evenly distribute pressure. Engineers were encouraged to file as many patents as possible to prevent competition from creeping into a market that didn’t exist at the time, the people said, asking not to be identified as they aren’t authorized to speak publicly.


All seemed on track till last week, when reports of damage to review models started to surface, from a malfunctioning screen after a thin film was peeled off to a display that flickered wildly. Samsung retrieved the units but initially maintained the product would launch as planned on April 26. On Monday, executives convened at their headquarters and debated for hours before finally pulling the plug, the people said."

Patel had tacitly supported the Congress in previous state assembly election in 2017. His formal entry into the party ahead of the general elections comes with an eye on the crucial Patel support base. The community, which accounts for nearly 12% of the state’s population, was instrumental in the BJP’s rise in Gujarat in the early nineties, after the Congress alienated them."

Cancer remains one of the biggest killers in the world with the number of new cases each year projected to reach 23.6 million by 2030, according to International Agency for Research on Cancer. There is light at the end of the tunnel, says Geetha Manjunath, founder of Niramai, a healthtech startup leveraging an AI-driven solution that detects cancer and abnormalities.


“Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women. Today, only one in two women with breast cancer has a chance of survival. This is paradoxical given that breast cancer is completely curable,"" says Dr. Manjunath. Late detection and delayed check-ups are the biggest impediment in the battle against cancer. Early detection can be achieved by employing data-based decision-making. Data-based operations are far more scalable and efficient. “That is what we are working towards,"" says Dr. Manjunath.


“We are confident that with more specialty hospitals turning to data-driven solutions, the cost of cancer testing and treatment will reduce to about 1/6th of the present cost. Early diagnosis will become reality,"" she says.


Organizations like Niramai are making rapid strides in accuracy in medical decision-making. The early symptoms of most diseases tend to be similar, which means physicians dispense generic medication to most patients. Generic medication has its merits—it’s cheap and works well against common infections. But India’s dependency on mass-produced, easily available antibiotics is dangerous for public immunity. Prescribing generic medicine for severe ailments is unsafe and ineffective, which is why we need precision medicine that is ideal for a particular patient, based on individual anatomy."

New Delhi: Xiaomi and Samsung are the arch rivals in the India smartphone market but it doesn't mean they do not have anything to learn from each other. Ask Xiaomi's India Managing Director Manu Kumar Jain and you have the answer.

It could prove to be a bad omen for emerging markets, though, as assets named ""most crowded"" usually sink soon afterwards


LONDON: Investors made a U-turn on emerging markets, naming them the most crowded trade, in Bank of America Merrill Lynch's survey for the first time in its history.

"Cloud is the weakest link: Cloud computing is an integral part of any enterprise’s operations. It allows stakeholders in the company to access their data from any location or device. To make this process less complicated, often the level of verification and security are not very stringent. This makes services running on the cloud more vulnerable to cyberattacks compared to on-premise services.


To break into cloud networks, hackers only need access to one of the employees’ email or computer account, which they acquire by sending a phoney mail (that might appear genuine) with a malicious link hoping the target will click on it. According to a 2018 report by Dome9., 18% of organizations were involved in cloud related security breaches in 2017.


Mobile and IoT are the Achilles heel: For ease of operations, most organizations have relaxed their bring your own device rules, allowing employees to routinely access work-related data through their personal smartphones. This proliferation of personal devices at workplaces has increased the risks for companies. According to Checkpoint, cybercriminals can spy on users and capture their login credentials while they log in to corporate systems containing sensitive data via their smartphones. Internet of Things (IoT) is another area that is growing very fast with little regard to security. Checkpoint rues that the problem with IoT device security is that the solutions are often poorly coded."

"Though it isn’t yet widely available, the infrastructure is already on its way for mobile communications and the Internet of things. The spending to roll out DSRC tools might ultimately prove redundant. And it’s easy to overstate how quickly the latter can be introduced – it takes some time for laws to take effect, and the technology isn’t widespread in cars now. By the time both happen, 5G could already be the prevalent technology.


Allowing multiple standards to develop in tandem would be a relief for Nokia Oyj and Ericsson AB, who are justifiably fearful that insisting on DSRC would delay the widespread rollout of 5G.


It’s worth remembering that we are a long way from a time when autonomous cars roam the roads freely. So backing a particular standard would be foolish when the full requirements aren’t yet known. An agnostic approach to regulation is therefore absolutely sensible.


The advantage of rejecting the regulation is that it still leaves all options on the table. Could it make life harder for the likes of VW? Yes. a standard mandating DSRC would make it easier to stave off the competitive threat from the telecoms industry."

"A currency accord will likely require China to avoid devaluing to gain a competitive advantage, US trade representative Robert Lighthizer said last week, though he also said that there isn’t yet a final agreement. That was a shift from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s previous remarks that the US and China had concluded “one of the strongest agreements ever on currency"".


Currency provisions have become an increasingly common feature of US trade deals in recent years. The Barack Obama administration insisted on including a commitment to not engage in competitive devaluations in the Trans-Pacific Partnership it negotiates with Japan and 10 other economies. The Donald Trump administration insisted on the inclusion of something similar in a renegotiated Nafta.


But by and large the provisions have been seen as symbolic and toothless. The Trump administration has also proven reluctant to act on the president’s rhetoric before. During his 2016 campaign Trump promised to officially label China a currency manipulator and take tough action. Two years into his presidency, however, the US treasury has declined to follow through on that threat."
"“Majority of IoT devices currently rely on local network security, which means that everyone on the same network can gain access to them. If a security camera, for example, gets hacked and the attacker is able to get into the network, he/she can control most of the other IoT devices connected to the same network as the camera,"" warned Iliushin.


According to a report by Barracuda Labs, improvements have been made but new types of vulnerabilities have emerged like IoT credential compromise wherein, attackers exploit vulnerabilities in mobile and web applications to acquire credentials to access data saved on cloud. “From an end user standpoint, unsecured IoT devices pose the highest risk to the privacy of a consumer. A vulnerable IoT device can give away your location, passwords, and data,"" cautions Sajan Paul, director systems engineering at Juniper Networks, India and SAARC. To avoid such attacks, consumers need to regularly update their devices, check default privacy and security settings, and change them as per their needs. Mikhail Kuzin, security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, believes that even if vendors begin to provide devices with better security now, it will be a while before old vulnerable devices are phased out of homes. Krishnapur recommends that users need to invest in more secure routers with in-built protection. He adds that they can also consider setting up a second network for IoT devices that doesn’t share access to other devices and data."

There is no complete list available online, and consumers may not know if Facebook is pre-loaded unless they specifically ask a customer service representative when they purchase a phone.


Consumer-advocacy groups have been sceptical of such arrangements for years, according to Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy.


“It’s only recently that people have become to understand that these apps really power the spy in your pocket,"" he said. “Companies should be filing public documents on these deals, and Facebook should turn over public documents that show there is no data collection when the app is disabled.""

Would you call music streaming companies an evolution of distribution companies? If yes, how will it affect the industry in the long term?


I would say, yes. I believe in ubiquity for the artists. I think artists should be on all platforms, and platforms should not win based on exclusivity. That’s bad for the consumer. The platform should win based on their product and their relationship with the customer. The artist should not have to choose what service they should be on. We’re not looking for exclusivity. We don’t think it’s a good customer experience.


I think it’s in a nascent stage and needs evolution. I think you’re experiencing the 2.0 version of streaming. One of my concerns is to make sure it’s not simply an echo chamber for somebody’s tastes and they still have the ability to experience artists and songs that they didn’t know they wanted. I believe one of the most important things that we could continue to evolve is creating tools for artists, labels, songwriters, and publishers to be able to focus on building and acquiring fans."

The future of the travel and hospitality sector will also be an era of alliances, where today’s disruptors get disrupted, making way for a new and sustainable ecosystem.


The current complex travel ecosystem will consolidate and equalize power of demand and supply. Technology will redefine the role of ecosystem players in the value chain and visionary companies will try to gain direct access to either customers or inventory. There is potential for the direct foray of technology giants and social media players into the travel ecosystem as they have access to customers which may disrupt the online travel aggregators. Alliances are expected to eventually pave way for a viable ecosystem. The boundaries are blurring and partnerships are emerging.


For example, Marriott has partnered with Alibaba’s OTA Fliggy to access Chinese tourists, while Amazon has partnered with Kayak for voice-based bookings through Alexa. Collaborations such as Airbnb’s latest investment in Oyo Rooms will also change the way the industry grows.


Technology players like Google are making the local intermediary roles relevant again with its Google Trips, a personalized tour guide app connecting local tour operators to travellers. Travellers are bound to gain the maximum value for the money spent and will be spoilt for choice as they will be at the heart of innovation. Today, smartphones are acting as personal digital assistants and in the future, they will emerge as personal digital ‘advisors’. On the provider side, a minimum viable ecosystem of travel and hospitality players is likely to emerge, with direct access to either inventory or customer."
"The Narendra Modi government simply finished the job of electrification started by previous governments, but quality of access still remains an issue. (Pradeep Gaur/Mint)


In the five years of Narendra Modi government, India witnessed near-universal electrification, but the quality of power access remains an issue, a Mint analysis shows


Mumbai/New Delhi: In its 2014 election campaign, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) promised to bring development, and specifically electricity, to all of India’s villages and homes. However, by then, almost all of India’s villages (97%) already had an electricity connection, according to data from the Central Electricity Authority (CEA). This left the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance-II (NDA-II) to simply finish the job.


It did this, amid much fanfare, in April 2018 when Leisang in Manipur became India’s last village to be electrified. The NDA-II has electrified 20,910 villages, some in India’s most remote locations, but the bulk of the work had been done by previous regimes—the United Progressive Alliance-II (UPA-II) electrified 80,189 villages and UPA-I 52,611 villages.


Village electrification, however, is only the first step in delivering power across India. A village is declared electrified if just 10% of the households has electricity connections, which masks poor access at household-level. The bigger challenge facing the Narendra Modi government was to provide households with higher quality and regular supply of electricity. And even here, data suggests that the NDA-II were simply building on groundwork done by previous governments."

Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora referred to the model code of conduct and urged social media representatives to come up with a code similar to it. He said the code would be used for the ongoing election process in the ""immediate context"" and would be a lasting document in the long run.


The issues of appointment of dedicated grievance channel for expeditious action by the organisations, pre-certification and transparency in expenditure of political advertisements were also taken up, the statement said."
"With these techniques, machines are also learning to read and write. For years, experts questioned whether neural networks could crack the code of natural language. But the tide has shifted in recent months.


Organizations such as Google and OpenAI, an independent lab in San Francisco, have built systems that learn the vagaries of language at the broadest scales — analysing everything from Wikipedia articles to self-published romance novels — before applying the knowledge to specific tasks. The systems can read a paragraph and answer questions about it. They can judge whether a movie review is positive or negative.


This technology could improve phishing bots such as SNAP_R. Today, most Twitter bots seem like bots, especially when you start replying to them. In the future, they will respond in kind.


The technology also could lead to the creation of voice bots that can carry on a decent conversation — and, no doubt one day, will call and persuade you to divulge your credit-card information.


These new language systems are driven by a new wave of computing power. Google engineers have designed computer chips specifically for training neural networks. Other companies are building similar chips, and as these arrive, they will accelerate AI research even further.


Jack Clark, head of policy at OpenAI, can see a not-too-distant future in which governments create machine-learning systems that attempt to radicalize populations in other countries, or force views onto their own people.


“This is a new kind of societal control or propaganda,"" he said. “Governments can start to create campaigns that target individuals, but at the same time operate across many people in parallel, with a larger objective.""


Ideally, artificial intelligence could also provide ways of identifying and stopping this kind of mass manipulation. Mark Zuckerberg likes to talk about the possibilities. But for the foreseeable future, we face a machine-learning arms race."
"The traffic challan payment is also restricted to Mumbai, Vijaywada and Telangana and more cities would be added soon.

"“We are not like Western countries, where people are exposed to the other gender since a very young age. We do not have the concept of dating from a young age and that is why it becomes difficult to have a fling or a short-term relationship,"" said Siddharth Mangharam, chief executive of Floh, a platform that connects singles through events.


TrulyMadly (Trulymadly Matchmakers Pvt. Ltd), founded by former MakeMyTrip executive Sachin Bhatia, along with Rahul Kumar and Hitesh Dhingra, reported a 50% drop in revenue in FY18, according to its latest filings with the Registrar of Companies. The firm’s revenue halved to ?3.60 crore in FY18 from ?7.20 crore in the year earlier, documents sourced from intelligence platform Paper.VC showed.


""This is for TrulyMadly India. Our main company Truly Madly Pte. Ltd. Is based in Singapore, and all revenues are booked at the Singapore company, these are just India, Truly Madly India. Our revenue from subscription has almost doubled from ?1.14 crore to ?1.94 crore. We have cut down our team from about 50 people to 15 members. We have removed the advertisement model because that was falling flat for us. The company has realigned and now we are only focusing on the subscription model. We have launched a few new features like Spark, TM forever and so on,"" said Snehil Khanor, chief operating officer of TrulyMadly.


Frivil, another dating app, was acquired by shaadi.com for an undisclosed amount in 2016. ICrushiFlush, which got a seed round from IDG Ventures (now Chiratae Ventures) in 2015, has not been able to raise more funds. Even TrulyMadly, which managed to raise $5.7 million in a Series A round in 2015, has been struggling to bring in funds."
"Further, SBICAP Securities says delivery of the fuel-efficient Boeing 737 Max aircraft, which is expected to improve overall operating economics of the aircraft by 8-9%, has commenced, although it is still early days to gauge the benefits of this. In that backdrop, performance in the current quarter and the next one will be critical to watch out for.


Despite these tailwinds, the fact that SpiceJet shares continue to trail far behind those of IndiGo shows that investors, shaken by last year’s crisis, are still preferring to play safe and bet on the market leader."
"Two, Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has turned from a fawning Modi fan to a vocal critic. Thackeray has been holding well-attended rallies with the stated purpose to “defeat Modi and Amit Shah"", though the MNS is not directly contesting the elections. He is indirectly helping the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) nominees. Ironically, the MNS had not fielded candidates in 2014 to help ensure a BJP?victory. In fact, in the last two weeks, Raj Thackeray has emerged as the biggest star campaigner for Congress-NCP.


Three, the campaign coordination between Congress and the NCP has been better this time, though the opposition combine has run short of state-wide star campaigners. NCP chief Sharad Pawar has been the only leader who has been able to match chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’ hectic campaign schedule across the state."

""BJP has decided to place 1500 boxes in different constituencies so that people can give their suggestion and take part in the preparation of the manifesto. But we are also encouraging people to express their criticism of the government to understand what were shortcomings of the government in their views,"" said a senior BJP leader who is part of the manifesto team."

"UDAY mandated that discoms bring the gap between average revenue and average costs to zero. Here, too, there has been progress with the gap reducing (from ?0.60/kWh in 2015-16 to ?0.17/kWh in 2017-18), but 21 of 26 states are still unlikely to meet the target.


According to a National Institute of Public Finance and Policy study, this data suggests that the UDAY scheme is failing to turn around the power sector. The authors also find that discoms remain plagued by operational inefficiencies such as lack of effective billing procedures, poor measurement of power consumption, and ineffective monitoring of power theft.


Taken together, data shows that the NDA has built on the previous government’s work to get more households electrified—but quality of access still remains an issue.


While the government has tried to address this by improving the financial health of discoms, much more needs to be done. The inability of successive governments to revive discom fortunes could have important ramifications for India’s development.


The World Bank estimates India’s electricity demand to treble by 2040. Addressing this rising demand will be critical for the development agenda of whichever party is elected to form the next government."
"Ripple also helps bank customers send money to people in many emerging markets including Mexico, India, and Thailand to increase their share of “this large and growing market"". What’s next? “Ripple is moving beyond blockchain, and connecting networks so that we can move money across networks. Again this is open-source and lightweight so it becomes easy to transfer money across networks. So we are building the ecosystem for networks to connect with each other and in our view globalization will be completed when data, goods and money flow seamlessly. That’s the way we think of it as an internet of value when the whole world gets connected through payment systems,"" Gupta said."
